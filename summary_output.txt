Don't think I am a crazy fan of MOTO.
Believe it or not, only 4 mobile cameras in the world is having better DXOMark rating than this, but they are all flagship models from Samsung and HTC.
If you install CPU-Z, you can reveal these.Also, it keeps two speedy cores shut down during normal usage ensuring power save.
So i returned and replaced the phone.
Purchased a phone through OKAY enterprises.
There were minor scratches on the sides of the phone.
I feel that the display is well protected and will not need any screen protector or scratch guard, though that is totally your choice.2.
I have purchased the 3 GB RAM + 32 GB Internal Storage variant.
I have attached some photo samples with this review, some photos are cropped for privacy reasons.
You can twist the phone twice to switch on the camera.4.
I watch about 30 minutes of YouTube, use the Facebook app for a few minutes, talk for about 5 minutes, play Wynk Music for about an hour and keep the screen brightness to about 80%.
The back is texturized, giving a good grip to hold the phone.
I used to face problems with high-speed cards in the Moto E, but it doesn't happen here.
Heating?I have noticed people complaining about the device getting heated up.
:-)However, I have not tested the phone with graphic-heavy and intensive apps and games.
If it does heat up then, it means that the phone is designed for medium usage, not for high-graphic gaming.All in all, I think this phone is really value-for-money and one of the best phones out there.
Pathetic delivery though i understand the high demand makes it complicated.Build and Design 9/10The build quality is amazing, i know many people will like a metal chassis but come on the plastic doesn't feel cheap, instead the metal body gets more prone to heating, the design is amazing as i like the fingerprint scanner to be placed on the front not all people will like it there but you know perspectives differ.
I went thru all the reviews on Amazon, youtube, other sites etc.
The camera sensor is a wide angle one.-Speakers have nice sound output, though not the best.-I played few games like asphalt 8, real racing, dream league soccer, mini militia and more.
Camera is also good4.
Battery will last a day at max for normal usage with 4G on whole day.5.
Loud speaker not too good.Some pice of phone attached with review..
I just play 10-15 min game phone is very very heat.
please advise what i do?????.
Which is very irritating.6) Turbo Charger takes 1 hr 45 min to fully charge the battery from 20% to 100%.7) I'm not game addict &amp; don't play games in mobile.
0-100% charging is done in 75-85 min.Remaining aspects like build quality, screen, sound etc as such you might have already known about all those.
Have been using it for a week now and no major complaints thus far.
The white coloured version doesn't absorb dirt as compared to the Moto g3 .5 .
It comes with many new options like gestures and moto display.
Etc...9.
I suggest u go for the 32 GB model with 3 GB RAM ..The CONs :1.
One of the best thing is battery, it nearly lasts through the day.
- Good Delivery.Here I discussed some pros and cons.Pros:I am not install any game in my phone (Actually I am not interested to play games), that's why phone is faster and also help me to use my apps with the help of 3GB RAM.There is no heating problem except that time when 25w Turbo charger is connected.Camera IS awesome Quality, Outdoor Photo size is 6.5MB and Clarity is superfine from rear Camera, also Front Camera is good for Selfie and Video calling.
For most parts it did not even get warm.
I clicked pictures, shot normal and slowmotion videos of about 3-5 mins  and it did get warm but it did not affect the performance.
Stock android feels great.
All the features are great and really fast auto focus .
Turbo charger charged it from 0 to100% in 100 mins .And in 15 mins it charges 20 % which is really handy.Fingerprint unlock  - 100 % accurate and fastMoto features like gestures for camera , flash light, and others are more useful than i thought.This phone is good for1) heavy wifi internet users ( i have not tested it with mobile data)2) Photography enthusiasts3) people wanting reliability and brand value4) people wanting stock android and quick updatesStay away if you are1) heavy game userI hope this review helps.
I have played games for more than an hour it barely heated.
I have had no problems with the set with 15 days usage.
Yes all the heating problem that everyone is talking about is there , but it is very normal for almost all the phones .So I feel the heating problem should not bother you .
The best part is the camera ,it really surprises you with quality ,especially when Moto is not known for its camera.
Slow motion video are good but don't compare it to Apple .
I got this mobile on 23 may and it's the Amazing phone I ever bought ... no hanging problem no bugs and battery backup is extremely good.
Light weight4.
Fast and amazing touch5.
Thumbs up for my side for the modest users..
But mine doesnt have any.
Everything is proper as described in promo and description.
The phone is really good.
Especially when you connect it with laptop and charge it, it burns.
I didnt get my finger wrong even once.
Very fast.. Good sound.. Only battery problem..
also the fingerprint works like a premium phones of 40-50K, in first hour i had downloaded and started playing 2-3 games simultaneously with high graphics out of which one was very heavy, again super experience with no lag whatsoever, i had also used Wifi and browsed few websites simultaneously while playing games, multitasking with no problem and worked as good as it can, btw it took time for me to get used to no home button.
Battery Back up seems to be good.3.
OTG works fast.Not to the expectation1.
(Iphone 6S score 82)I waited for the review release(pic attached) and bought this phone just 1 minute after the launch at midnight.Camera sample image attached 100%crop &amp; original .I'm loving every bit of it.Superfast delivery by amazon..
Amazing camera.
For me, that's really good enough!What I love about this device:1.
phone was just kept without inserting it in a protection , something like polythene cover.9) there comes no USB cable , with this phone.10) while the apps were getting downloaded, i saw lag while scrolling down whatsapp contacts.NOW GOOD POINTS1) Camera quality is very very very good , they have got benchmark of 84 (this is the rating that phone industry gives) camera.
the rating is greater than iphone 6 plus .
i have cancelled the back cover order.
Same as the previous earphones.Heating:-  Yes , it also heats up a lot .
It looks like a costly handset.Camera :- Not much better than other smartphones in this range .
Camera - camera is awsome on day light, but in low light it seems to be so sad... image size is likely above 4MB so i guess my google backup will need more storage.Front cam is not as much as perfect as expected but rearcam will overcome that expectation.Advantage is that its light weight and too slim, so if you are careless you would be buying another one soon...3GB ram is awsome i can play clash of clans, same time could keep up with my whatsapp chat, when went back to game, no loadings.. no lags as smooth as possible.Around 24 GB is available now, thus i dnt need a external storage....
Good sides.1 Handy2 Battery life is good3 Touch is Awesome smooth.5  Wifi and Network connectivity is good.6 Camera 16 and 5, good quality.7 Stock version Android.8 Memory 32 gb, expandable 128gb.............Bad sides.1 Heating issue2 No waterproof3 Ordinary earphones.Its been now a week bought this phone through Amazon.in all was good from Amazon.About phone its an awesome phone, very smooth functionality.
I have not even had one failed attempt yet.
Under the sun, I just had to bump up the brightness to 50% and everything was visible perfectly well.Processor is smooth and in case you are wondering, theres heating.
The plastic textured back does help to limit the heat felt on your hand.
So, i'd rate it 9.5/10 for the features and performance this device provides in this price segment.Go for it, buy it and enjoy.Hope this review helps many potential buyers..
Reached within 4 days of order placement!By the specifications of the phone one could imagine the performance of the phone.In terms of form factor it is almost close to a phablet but still one can hold it in one hand.
Does the job, light weight, nice camera(better than zukZ1 and note3), elegant design, Moto brand trust, smooth gaming, average battery.
USB cable has to be bought separately.5.
Excellent delivery timeline by Amazon.
But trust me, it has not once disappointed me.
I have been using this phone since May 22nd n I have liked the phone.Its has a lacklusture processor but the phone makes it up with the awesome camera and decent looks.I had ghost touch issue while charging the phone but it seems the fault with the turbo charger.
( No, I did not opt for replacement)There are heating issues but it is not a deal breaker as I personally use my cell for social networking, browsing and taking snaps n have not found any instances where the phone gets severely heated.The finger print scanner works like a charm !!
Somewhat pixelate images in indoor but that too with every phone and in comparison with other its far better.
Purchased on 26.After a lot of search I choose this phone.Camera is superb.immediately got an system update.
I had bought my new moto g4.
I was using oneplus 2 but stopped using it now because of G4 ease of use and turbo charging feature.
Though NFC is missing but never used it so far on the other sets I had.
With turbo charging feature I'm not worried about battery, however battery lasts your working day easily with normal usage.
Only feature I miss compared to one plus is the home button integration with fingerprint and double tap to switch off display.
Not worth for Rs.15000, better than this lenovo Zuk z1 is very good.
It has some class.and camera is even better than iPhone 6s or Nexus 6p..This is short review u might help full...
Just loving it.
I found out that the glass of the phone is not supposed to be curved like my phone.
While, Gaming is also very gud.But charging mode handset was hang slow and not working ,.
I am an ardent fan of Moto series of mobile phones and this didn't disappoint me either.Build quality is somewhat compromised compared to the previous versions and so does the looks.
Camera will stand out for sure.
The finger print recognition works perfectly.Nothing to worry about heating problem as I can see a lot of people cribbing about it.
Very good camera with full manual mode.
Totally in love with it, few minor concerns which mayb overlooked...  Like adaptive brightness too sensitive,  miss design and pebble like feel from motog.
Finger sensor is good.3.
Awesome phone but overheating is a problem.
Both the sim slots are not working...updated :  My issue was with the sim card which was cropped from mini sim card..Please do not use cropped sim cards ...buy a micro sim card instead ...No issues from the mobile.
no infrared sensor.5.
Best product in this price segment.Pros:1.
Application will switch without lagging.2.
Camera quality is very good : You will get nice pic even in low light.
Stock android :  running a pure, clutter-free version of Android with no unnecessary software4.
1hr and 15-20 min it take to full charge.6.
I bought this phone on 18 may and got it on 25.
Colors are vividly displayed on its 5.5 inch screen which also holds the speaker.Looks a little like Samsung Note3 but a whole new level of technology when operated.
Moto doesnt have its own dedicated Gallery and Music apps for the phone.
It lasts around 12 hours for a normal usage.
But the turbocharger Feature overcomes this problem.3.
The Camera drains a lot of battery.
The phone gets heated up a bit over but it's common problem seen in phones these days and you won't the heat that muh because of the plastic case cover.8.
I have tested taking a video for 5 min and it got heated like hell right after 3 min of recording.
Excellent product and superb performanc, good camara quality and excellent touch and finger print sensor.
I recommend this to all my friends and other readers of this review.
Really sharp &amp; looks amazing even in sunlight.I am a fan of the memory (RAM) management of this phone.Fingerprint scanner works beyond belief.
Initially i am in oscillation that whether to buy this mobile or not.Its all because of many negative reviews.after reading some review i have ordered 3GB variant.
Phone is truly awesome.
Camera quality has enhanced from its previous versions..
Other than a little heating during charging and heavy usage,the device is excellent for an everyday average user.the heating doesn't affect the performance at all..the camera the fingerprint sensor are exceptional.
Superb features for the price we pay..
( good built quality charger - 25W )+ A good finger print sensor works pretty well, can add up to 5 finger prints+ Moto Active Display, Really helpful, i feel lik advanced experience in lockscreen notification and control.+ A hidden notification light right side of the finger print sensor.+ Has OTG Support.
Although, i don't really like the placement of the fingerprint sensor , as one will constantly mess it up with a home screen button.
It's fast, it's reliable.Battery..3000 mah battery , lasts for like 30 hours with normal usage.
The phone faces a stiff competition with the likes of Redmi note 3 and Lenovo ZUK Z1 into the mix, but still if i had to go for one of them, i would pick the moto any time of the day.PS- Thanks to Amazon.
I am giving this 5 out of 5 stars because the delivery time and the product quality is excellent even though there was no bubble wrappings.
!And camera... you must be kidding me!!!!
Very good mobile for the price range.
Fingerprint is again awesome but I would have preferred it at back.
Minus is absence of screen customisation for the large screen and no other use for finger print reader other than finger print reading.
All the Xaomi and One Plus in the market can try their best but still cant match the quality and accuracy of the product.High points: 1.
Call quality  4.
Even if we do , it is not malfunctioning only heating mildly.
The phone certainly feels good to hold but the heating problem will get to your nerves .You get nervous about using it with many accidents about phone blast no longer being a rare thing.
The phone is very good from holding perspective.
Following things i want to make aware to people before they go for it to purchase.1.
Which is really bad process.
After all the negative vibe about this i insisted to buy this phone kos i trust in motorola as i am using moto G 1 for more than 3 years!
moto has gave us 2 SYSTEM UPDATEs .
DONT EVEN DARE TO COMPARE TO THE CHINESE BRANDS ZUK,MI OR ANY IN THE MARKET!
CAMERA AND PHONE IS SO LIGHT!
JUST USE IT AND PLEASE STOP THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS KOS AM CURRENTLY USING IT..
Awwesome !!!
A great camera!!.
I received my new moto g4 plus day before yesterday.
I used WhatsApp for an hour and the phone overheated like a fireball.
Phone has good features.
For 15k u can't ask for anything more...
But so any other smartphone.No competition in this price bracket; camera literally will out compete flagships.
It does misses out on OIS.
The mobile gets full marks when it comes to camera both rear and front camera and with unique feature such as power chargimg it really charges mobile in 15 minutes as promised by Motorola.
Really Very nice Product !!
Do not believe any negative reviews on this phone..
Battery Backup is really very bad.
I would like to know if this is a defected product or the phone has this issue with every piece.
Awesome product except the heating issue.
(Videos downloaded from Youtube *.MKV files).
I think those are hardware not support formats..
The phone works well, gaming is smooth, camera is way better than previous generation, display is also very good, pretty good in outdoors.
