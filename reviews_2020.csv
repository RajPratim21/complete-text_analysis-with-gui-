5.0 , 13 March 2015,"Beautiful story...i think...revolution 2020 is the best novel written among of his novels...everything is there...romance...love...hate..complication...politics...and also suspense...full..package of 'masala'..."
5.0 , 29 March 2015,"All the time now Revolution 2020 moves around my mind.If i would have been in Gopal's place i would have played my cards well &amp; would have achieved the Hierarchy,but Gopal doestnt.This makes me think in todays scenario is there any person who will sacrifice his love,oppurtunies???I cant say any thing more,coz i'm speechless after reading this."
4.0 , 30 January 2016,"I am not an avid reader but occasionally I do read and after the much hype of 2 States movie I bought this and <a class="a-link-normal" href="/Half-Girlfriend/dp/8129135728">Half Girlfriend</a> . And as usual after reading them 6 months ago I kept procrastinating to express my view on it.I've got to say that Chetan Bhagat is not a bad writer that our media is so desperately trying to prove and our comedian trying to make a laugh about him.This book is a good read, but after 1 read I didn't opened it for another go. But nevertheless this book can be made into a movie, I am shocked to see that not one of the Bollywood directors have poached it for a film."
4.0 , 6 September 2014,"Really affected a lot on my mind even after reading its effect was on my mind till smthg 4 days..gopal was truely a good man..infct I might hv fallen in luv wid him..diz guy deserves smthg btr.atlst now arti n raghv should know d fact."
1.0 , 9 September 2015,"Printing quality is very poor. Unable to read first 25 pages because it's printed in very dark ink hence both side writing is visible from any side."
4.0 , 26 November 2013,"I got this book and "what young India wants" mentioned as Bhagat's first non-fiction together and I am tempted to consider this as the first non-fiction! Perhaps with this the there was a slow shift to non-fiction this one being basically a story. With the mention of 2020 timed some years later much fictionalisation can appear real as one reads. The order of publication makes sense since reading this book before "first non-fiction" prepares the reader for the later book where there is some presentation of solutions for the reader to consider.With both books available together now, I would suggest one to buy both but read this one first and the other later. May be keep the non-fiction book somewhat out of reach till you are done with this one!"
5.0 , 4 July 2015,"I jus loved the plot....I was more interested to read about Aarti and Gopal than the corruption and related stuffs with raghav.Quite interesting at the beginning and when the corruption part comes bit boring,but compared to the over all story itz worth reading,...."
5.0 , 26 September 2014,"I could say this is the best novel i have ever read.Specially 1st half is awsome Just because I could relate to the character apart from the fact that I have never experienced any incident like the lead character in reality.HOSTELITES MUST READ."
2.0 , 27 November 2014,"Revolution 2020 is my least favorite novel by Chetan Bhagat. But still it has its heart in the right place. The novel highlights the unscrupulous ways of politicians, deceiving ways of achieve success and the misuse of power. I like these aspects of the novel which serves as a solid lesson for the youth. But what was disappointing was the love story….the characters seemed extremely confused and it was quite irritating to read about their thought process…."
4.0 , 12 May 2016,"Chetan Bhagat was indeed successful in bringing up all the corruption related to the context. He knows exactly what Indians want to read and framed the story accordingly. Grabing our attention, making us indulge in the story and does his job of conveying us want he wants us to tell. Brilliant!"
5.0 , 13 September 2015,"A book so hard to hate. The chemistry between Gopal and aarti there conversations, the superb story are some of the highlights of the book. After reading the book i guess Gopal was not the bad guy instead the circumstances made him do the bad things. Overall a must read chetan Bhagat book."
5.0 , 30 September 2015,"After completing this boo.. I was amazed by Gopal's decision he made, that was the turning point of the story and made him Hero in his own eyes as well as for readers.. Seriously now a days it very rare or no one who can sacrifice his love, ambition for someone's happiness who deserve it."
4.0 , 13 December 2015,"I'm reading Chetan Bhagat's novel for the first time and I must this indeed was a good noveIt is about two friends, Gopal and Raghav. In the beginning it shows how Gopal struggles to find a name and how he fights poverty and Raghav had cleared two major engineering colleges but his heart wasn't into it. Both of them fight for winning Aarti's (their childhood friend)  heart. On the contrary, Gopal becomes rich later by establishing a new college whereas Raghav drops his ambition of becoming an engineer and instead becomes a journalist. As the story progresses, Raghav establishes a new newspaper namely ' Revolution 2020 ' which aims at fighting against corruption.I felt, the book had a meek ending but still, it managed to keep me perplexed and intrigued by the plot."
3.0 , 23 May 2014,"I have been a fan of Chetan Bhagat for his excellent writing ability. His books like "Five point someone", "2 States", "3 mistakes of my life" will fill up my heart as forever. But this book really disappointed me. Story is about 2 boys and 1 girl on the background of Varanasi. It is about the difference of those two boys who used to be friends and role of the girl in their life. Story was going well but in the midway, it got extremely boring. Needless to say its ending has not been much interesting as I expected. Message of the story is good and also the finishing was touching. But something is missing that's my opinion as a reader. That is why I am rating it 3 stars."
3.0 , 20 August 2013,"i am an admirer of bhagat's writing and have read all his books published till date.bhagat is loved mostly because of his smart n crisp writing, simple language, the freshness of his tone and a sound understanding of the young minds.his books like five point someone,one night at a call center,three mistakes of my life etc. had just increased our expectation from him.but,i think,this book did not excel to that level.it lacked the uniqueness.at one point of time,u will think that you r reading about a Bollywood masala movie.it's just too filmy.and.when you finish reading the book,it's just 'finished'. it's an one timer.you will not feel the urge to read it again."
5.0 , 22 May 2016,"It is written in very simple language yet very entertaining. Undoubtedly, simplicity is the forte of Chetan Bhagat. The movement I started it, could not resist my self until I completed. Go ahead and read it."
5.0 , 23 May 2014,"As the title aptly suggests, this is a story of love, unfulfilled ambitions and corruption in the system. A story about a young boy, who wants to make it big in life. The book is very well written and you can't help but feel for Gopal, the protagonist. As a reader, you can virtually visualise the lanes and ghats of Varanasi, even if you've never been there.  I finished reading the book with a tear in my eyes. The story will linger at the back of your mind, even long after you finish reading the book and thats the best thing I liked about it! Take a bow, Mr. Chetan Bhagat for writing this beautiful piece of story!!!"
4.0 , 3 May 2016,"nice book..to pass ur time....it depends on reader what type of book they like... but the story is very nice ... [...]  .....the link is the review.... get one its woth nice story.."
5.0 , 29 July 2013,"If any one wants to understand what jealousy is, no better way than to read this book. The depiction of this emotion alone is worth 5 stars for this book.After finishing the book, one tends to keep on thinking for a while that whatever happened to the main character is heart wrenching; and was there any alternative climax available, why did author chose this and not that !In Short :Love + Ambition + Failure + Extreme Jealousy + Sense of worthlessness + Corruption + Success + Ultimate Sacrifice = Revolution 2020 !!"
5.0 , 26 February 2014,"I am a big fan of chetan bhagat  and I can confidently say that this is  the best book written by him till date. Stuff packed with friends, love, career, money and life. Good shot by Chetan. I like the Gopal character very much particularly when he tried to bring her out from love life. This novel taught us that we need a revolution against the corruption.I am not sure about that revelution 2020 will make revolution or not in the real life of readers; but recommend that if you have interest in reading novel, once go for it."
5.0 , 27 June 2015,"ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, LOVE AND LIFE, THIS BOOK GIVES YOU. IT IS A MASTER PIECE AT A VERY REASONABE PRICE. YOU WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS BOOK AS ANY NUMBER OF TIMES YOU READ IT, YOU WILL NOT GET BORED. IT IS WORTH SPENDING YOUR VALUEABLE TIME AND MONEY ON IT .AMAZON OFFERS THIS BOOK AT A VERY LOW COST. BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR LIFE FROM A DIFFERENT LEVEL. IT WILL SURELY OF GREAT HELP TO YOU. AND DONT FORGET TO LIKE THE REVIEW IF IT WAS OF ANY HELP."
5.0 , 29 May 2016,"It was my first novel and I completely loved it.  Chetan Bhagat presented every situation in such a way that made me feel like I was actually witnessing it. I liked the love story with each and every conversation between Gopal and Aarti. But the sad ending was very disappointing.  Both of them loved each other and would have happily lived together as a couple. Hope if the writer comes up with the next part of the story that makes them meet again. I'm looking forward for the next part of the book. Thank you Mr. Chetan Bhagat for this one and this is among the best books of yours."
3.0 , 20 October 2014,"I usually don't prefer to read this genre, but the book was selling at an unbelievably low price (52Rs) which even a second hand book store won't provide. So i bought it anyway.Coming to the book. Easy going, never a place where you feel - you need to reread certain section. Author connected really well with majority of Indians who got whopped their asses in competitive exams. In fact, it might have appealed to so many people who feel they wasted their parents money on education. The author Introduces each character really well. I was expecting a bit of Bollywood emotional drama in some part of the book but didn't happen- all went reasonably well.Revolution 2020 sounds a bit of a misnomer, you don't see any thing which even remotely resembles to a revolution. In-fact you don't feel connected to the title until around 200 pages."
4.0 , 9 May 2016,"Good work by Chetan, felt grossly involved in the book.Though I am not an avid reader, this book I did not leave until I finished"
5.0 , 18 December 2013,"You would love to read this book and would be very close to your heart there after.Everyone in this world should have loved someone at some point of time and definitely this book would touch your sweet memories of your life."
5.0 , 15 February 2016,"Revolution 2020 is really awesome...I had the book nearly for 1 month in my bag without looking itt...but when I started reading it..I had completed the book in 2 days..n u know i had a nightout 2 complete this book as i have never n8outed 2 study my course...nw im going 2 read the book for third time...dont miss this book...nd dont miss aarthi n gopal.!!"
5.0 , 17 December 2013,"Failure is valued &amp; respected a step mote than success only in the beautiful relationship called "LOVE"........This is a nice book"
5.0 , 8 April 2014,"As Other Book of chetan Bhagat this also a Good book . when you complete this Book you will love ,corruption and Revolution is Best title for that book which also the title of this Book . When you start this book you can not stop it until you will finished this book . that is the attraction of this book"
3.0 , 17 July 2015,"Its easy to distinguish between black and white but what about grey shades?Beautifully constructed story which never loses track.You will feel for all the characters and this is where this is a winner.1 star less for rated-R content which, in my opinion, could have been avoided."
5.0 , 6 December 2015,"After reading this book, it made me think of two things. 1) It seems more real than a true story, even though I have no idea if this story was based on a true or on a fiction. 2) It raised my curiosity that what would have happened, "will Arati ever know the sacrifices of Gopal"."
1.0 , 7 April 2014,"I'm wondering why I wasted my time reading this. The climax doesn't make any sense at all. The story’s plot is too weak to make it a recommended read. The writer hasn’t given a reason why Gopal changed his mind at the last moment. The readers deserved a sensible reason on Gopal's weird decision and without it, I feel like a stupid having bought and read the book!"
5.0 , 17 December 2015,"Superb story, I usually don’t read books much but this book made me to become mad of reading Chetan's books. I like the way conversations portrayed between Gopal and Arthi. Coming to story this is a book which has Friendship, Love, Career, Luck, Education, Corrupted society…...."
4.0 , 2 July 2013,"I just started reading the books and one of my friend suggested this one. It's a nice story with mix of love, politics, friendship and ambition. Chetan Bhagat described the characters in a filmy way. I hope this Novel will become a Bollywood Movie within few months."
4.0 , 28 October 2014,"a really cool book may not as good as the other ones over all one readable copy .Even though  the story had  some neat touches  of bollywood masala. May be he have written it keeping in mind the future prospect of a movie . predictable but still a good book"
5.0 , 29 April 2015,"another amazing, heart touching and inspiring novel by chetan bhagat. truly loved the love story. what a great writing to express such revolutionary thoughts. thoroughly touched my heart. waiting for his next book.the most inspiring novel i read till date."
5.0 , 6 October 2015,"This is my first time reading a CB novel. I found the story very impressive and that's the reason I read it in 2 days. The quality of the product is very genuine. Great paperback and fine quality paper at such an affordable price. Thanks amazon after all."
3.0 , 9 September 2015,"Chetan as always has made a story out of no where. The only reason I did not give 5 star is I am ardent fan of his and read all his past books. This seemed to be an old formula therefore. I believe he can bring a little more suspense and thriller aspects"
5.0 , 6 January 2016,"Beautiful story, the way it unfolds it takes you through the journey of India. I like the Kota part of it because CB describe it very true. I don't like the novels which don't have happy ending but it has a social message, so I am giving it five starts."
1.0 , 19 February 2016,"END....1.Gopal must have saved shukla at the end by asking favour from raghav.2.shukla must have become an honest person after coming out of Jail.3.shukla must have adopted gopal as a son.Then It may have a Happy Ending..."

3.0 , 26 April 2015,"Revolution Twenty 20 is a story which travels nicely but ends stupidly. The author suddenly made twists and turns to finish it hastily. I think Chetan Bhagath needs to learn the art of writing stories "DECENTLY" with strong plot."

3.0 , 18 June 2015,"It could be a little too early to predict, but Revolution 2020 may just go down as Chetan Bhagat’s best work since Five Point Someone. After that sparkling debut in 2004, to me personally his writing had gone down a notch. One night at the Call Centre (2005) had a cop-out climax while 3 Mistakes of my life (2007) had OTT sensibilities and was too ‘filmy’ for me. CB recovered ground with 2 States (2009) by picking an interesting semi auto-biographical account of his own marriage but still the narrative was teetering on melodrama at various plot-points.R2020 is the story about three childhood friends in Varanasi - Aarthi, Raghav and the narrator, Gopal. Gopal has always loved Aarthi but following his debacle in JEE/AIEEE exams and in turn, moving to Kota for coaching, Raghav and Aarthi's relationship blossoms. Gopal fails at the second attempt of engineering exams. Following some dramatic incidents and with the help of a local politician, he starts an engineering college of his own in Varanasi... though with corrupt money and means. Raghav meanwhile chucks his IT-BHU engineering degree to take up journalism and is hell bent on creating a revolution to root out corruption from Varanasi. What follows is an exhilarating tale of power, corruption, love and greed.R2020 takes a contemporary issue of corruption in education, but it happens as a contrived scenario. The "revolution" happens only as an after thought and is not delved sufficiently enough to show how the change can be brought. Sure, it works at an individual level but is it sufficient at a national level? I do not think so. But the author succeeds in showing the ugly side of education in our country where colleges are now run by Sari shop owners, politicians, beedi-makers, anything but the academicians. There is also a strong undercurrent towards the apathy shown by the society towards students who are always judged by the ranks they get in the competitive exams.At its core, the book still remains a triangular love story. The usual CB trademarks are present in this one as well: The quirky one-liners, the oblivious in-jokes, the witty conversations between the couple, the customary sex scene and the jibes at man-woman relationship.The pace is brisk, editing crisp and even though this is Bhagat's longest book, you never feel the narrative dwindling into side-tracks and losing steam. The scenes between Gopal and Aarti are heartwarming: those coffee conversations, those boat rowing scenes near the Varanasi Ghats, those awkward pauses, they all add up in the end. Two scenes stood out for me - one in which Aarti shop around for Gopal before he leaves for Kota and another in which Aarti for the first time confessed how Gopal pushed her "too much" for a relationship. These are well thought off and executed scenes in writing where the exact emotions are unveiled for the characters.Now it may appear i am putting the book on the pedestal which is definitely not the intention. There are certain plot points which left me unsatisfied. There is not even one confrontation scene between Aarti and Raghav, latter of which is never ready to work on the relationship in his passion for the "change" in the society. In fact, the character of Raghav gets minimum footage when it comes to the love story and to me that was the most baffling portion of the book. I also thought the earlier portions of coaching in Kota were too elaborated and did not added up to the central theme, though did added to Gopal's woes and eventually bringing him to the lowest point in life.I believe in the coming days, jury will be out how good or bad CB is, how his literature sucks or rocks and all that jazz. I can even see another movie made on this book. People will keep arguing about the merits of his writing. But in the end, the sales numbers are already out – more than 5 lakh copies had been pre-ordered, which is by far the highest number for any Indian author. As far as R2020 is concerned, the fans of Chetan Bhagat won’t be disappointed at all.Read more reviews at http://loveisalwaysnew.blogspot.in/"

1.0 , 5 November 2015,"Hi ! everyone, I am kaushik sagi a thorough reader of chetan novels. The part which I like most is his sarcastic way of expressing a scene.Speaking about this novel, it is a distress screenplay written by Chetan with a sad ending.After reading this novel I felt pity for the character Gopal Mishra who had a tragic side from start to end. Gopal loved towards Aarti made him drove mad but he intentionally is not a psycho. If Aarti has understood the love of Gopal there would be a beautiful ending. Whatever case it turns to be, Aarti should have tied a knot with Gopal instead of Raghav. It is the worst novel and disaster novel I read in my life.....please do not read and spoil your mood..."

Mr.author Indian youth have enough masala in the Bollywood which is not what we expect in the literary works of a "celebrated writer""

Great books.....not so good books but this is the worstThere is no storyline,  utter non sense at all points and you call it a novel... A revolution indeed..... Having a good grammer does not mean you become a writer Mr. Chetan BhagatPs.  Chetan Bhagat you cant write a book......Just leave this sector of writing alone"
