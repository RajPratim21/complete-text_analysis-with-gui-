It has this rigid plastic back cover which seems like rubber from far but isn't and due to the texture type design on the back cover it stays in hand without slipping off easily and due to its light weight it feels comfy in hand and you'll love using it.Touch &amp; Display:- A Big Improvement from Previous Gens as this mobile packs an FHD (Full HD) Screen which is of 5.5 Inch which is just great and the display brightness can go from low to pretty bright.- The Viewing angles are also great!- Compared to some other devices you’ll find this screen a bit warm or to say it’ll feel more like a filter is added.- Touch is great and very responsive. You'll enjoy using this touch.Sound:- Speaker and Ear-Piece are both the same! Like dafuq?- It isn't loud but just gets the job done.- As the speaker is facing towards front or towards the person, while watching videos it’ll be loud enough.Camera:- It has 16MP sensor.- Turn on the Professional mode in camera to get more control over what and how you click by adjusting white balance, ISO, Shutter speed, Focus etc.- NO 4K recording.- Focusing is actually good and very fast...It's just a matter of seconds with the Laser AF- I wouldn't say that the Camera is extra ordinary but it's good.- Front Camera struggles very badly in low lighting.Fingerprint Sensor:- My Primary Device as of now is OnePlus2 and I compared both the devices in terms of fingerprint unlock and I'm Pretty amazed with the speedy unlock of this phone... Might be some 0.2 sec or 0.3Battery:Easily gets out through the day with moderate usage.I managed get a SoT of 6+ hours (Picture added)Turbo Charge is really amazing in this device which fills up the juice pretty quick likeAt 6:30 am - 5%8:16 am - 100%Benchmark Scores:AnTuTu: 42644 (Picture added)Vellamo: (Picture added)Browser - 2274Metal – 1352Multicore – 14783D Mark: 388 (Picture added)Bottom Line –  I feel like It’s a bit Over Priced but then it’s worth it if you are looking for a phone that gives you a stock experience  and If it is stock then almost everything is optimized for it then ultimately you are going to get the best user experience!I prefer it over the Redmi Note 3.[...]"
4.0 , 14 June 2016,"Amazing specification is charging speed ..within 15 mins it charges from 8% to approx 50% of charging..Second thing the gorilla glass .. with very low brightness it is so bright when you use it indoor purpose for out you need to increase to 20-30% that more than enough to view screen clearly. Third thing internal memory and ram performance.. they are making positive impact .. no lag in games,no struct during multiple application operation ..go for 3 GB ram series ..Fourth thing light weight,easy holding , comparatively with other phones having same size in length and breadth ..Fifth thing finger print sensor .. is also good .. it recognizes very fast .. I didn't get any problem during unlock.. some face problem in recognition .that's because when creating fingerprint sensor it asks 3to 4 times for overall finger so try slightly different positions with your finger for overall recognition.. then it works fine while unlocking ..ConsWith the turbo charging it charges in lightning speed but phone temperature also rises high .. so don't run any applications or ,WiFi,or mobile data during charging."

4.0 , 16 June 2016,"Moto G4 PlusA Bang For BuckFirst of all I would like to tell that I was just like every normal guy, read a lot of reviews , saw videos on youtube , visited moto support site.I was so informed about every little detail of even the processor that you could ask me anything.First I was planning to buy Xiaomi Redmi note 3, but it never came in stock, It was really a good one especialy SD 650.The first thing about Moto Is Android 6.0.1, which you would never get on xiaomi or get when android N would be released.- For heating IssueI would like to tell that yes this device heats but not on alaming levels, using camera heats a lot, that I would not deny.During charging it heats but if you do not use it while charging then it is Not at All a issue, I suggest that do not use your device while charging because this device charges up very very quickly, be a little patient to increase your device's life by many times.-Turbo ChargerYou would not get it on Xiaomi,Moto's Turbo charger is very very good. Solid Build Quality,Long cable,Very Fast Charging.Never Worry About Charging-BatteryVery good battery life. With doze mode you can get battery of a 3500Mah battery. And doze mode is all automatic, no hassles.-UIA total Stock android, very very basic.about 2.8 gb of ram available and 1.7 free on first boot.Night Mode is very cool.a feature called adaptive brightnessis very good.-FingerPrint ScannerAwesome 95%accurate,Fast and gives a very cool look to device.-DesignI would recommend the white colour ,looks very ELITE,I do not know about Black but I think that I would have not liked if had ordered black colour and it's up to your choice.The back of device is average not that good, but you can buy back covers, This would help in protection and prevent scratches on the metal bezels.Front Is very impressive though-CameraVery good camera, great quality.-PerformanceVery Good, no lag at all,not tried with HD games, I would soon tell you.-InternetReally very fast,I am talking about 2g. You get very good speeds even on 2g networks, I mean satisfying for what you pay.3G is superfast and more fast with this device4g not tried,not gonna try because I am satisfied with 3g speeds. I even have set my network from 4g to 3g, as it would save a little battery.And most of us do not need 4g and most of us don't use 4g.-SpeakerThe Placement Of speaker at the front is very cool. The voice of speaker is very loud ,clear , you can hear the bass clearly.Quality of earphones is normal, what others provide, nothing special-No USb cableUse a app called wifi transfer pro but not from play store find any apk cause it is full version.Install it then activate the hotspot on mobile and connect your laptop to this wifi hotspot.Open the app WTP tap start and follow instructions.Has Hidden LEDOnly Activates when you switch off your smartphones and connect chargerI am satisfied With this smartphone. listen to me I am no person who buys every smartphones. I am a normal person this is my socond smartphone in 3 years. I am no promoter, nor from moto, a normal citizen of india.I write this because many people have such confusions. I had this too. It is to show peaople a true path , so that people change their way of wrting reviews ."
5.0 , 23 May 2016,"Hi thereBought this phone on 18 may as soon as it went on sale.Some of FAQ's-Fingerprint scanner - YesMagnetic sensor- NONFC - NoOtg support - yesMicrosd - YES upto 128 GBIR blaster - NoTHERE IS NO LED NOTIFICATION LED , MANY REVIEWERS WERE SAYING THE LED IS THE BOTTOM OF DISPLAY, THAT IS MIC  lmao.In the Box -&gt; Moto g4 plus&gt; Too much of documentation&gt; Turbocharger 2.0 with fixed cable&gt;  Surprisingly Earphones are also includedBuild Quality------------------The bezel around the phone feels like metal but it is not clarified yet if it is Metal, To me it seems like really hard plastic used which gives feeling of metal. The back panel is user replaceable but battery is not removable, under that you will get 2 sim slots and microsd slot also. The back panel is textured and gives a lot better grip then xiaomi redmi note 3 i used. The phone is very slim.Hardware---------------The phone is powered by Snapdragon 617 chipset with adreno 405 GPU and coupled with 3 GB RAM , FOR POWER USERS I RECOMMEND 3 GB ALWAYS. The processor is an octacore but it is using same old A53 cores . Motorola says they have optimized the OS acc. to chip and there will be smooth experience and yes i experienced zero lag in my usage.Camera-------------Camera is a strong selling point here , Nothing comes close to this camera at this price. I used Redmi note 3 for 2 weeks but was not satisfied by the camera at all so very first day i ordered this phone and Believe the camera is brilliant on this thing. Laser assist autofocuses like crazy fast and that 16 MP sensor produces much natural Pictures compared to others , Lens used is f2.0 apperture and Produces crisps Bokeh effects.I will be adding Camera samples by tonight also. In low light performance it just destroys the redmi note 3 . The front facing camera is very wide and does performs quite well in low light also.Software --------------The phone runs Android MM 6.0 out of the box which gives it a plus point as compared to other in this range .The UI is as stock as it gets. I was using MIUI for past  2 weeks on Note 3 and i have to say there is nothing Like Stock Android Experience. Other than that MOTOROLA HAS PROMISED UPGRADE FOR ANDROID "N" AND ANDROID "O" and that was another main point which made me buy this over RN3.Battery------------The battery inside is 3000 mAh and gets the job done can't say much about it as i am still testing it and will update within few days. TURBOCHARGER is another thing that you don't get with others. It gets fully charged within 1 hour and 40 minutes, And you get Turbocharger inside the box.Fingerprint scanner-----------------------------The fingerprint scanner is on the front. Now it is personal preference for that. I personally like it at the front as opposed to at Back.It unlocks the phone in a blink and is better than RN3 i would say in some cases . Don't get me wrong here RN3 scanner is also superfast but due to some bugs the scanner sometimes freezes and you have to unlock it manually.Overheating------------------Yes the Heating problem is there with Snapdragon 617 Chip, you will only notice heating while charging , gaming and camera use.While my normal usage i was not experiencing any major heating.Hope this helps"
5.0 , 27 May 2016,"Having seen a mixed response on reviews, I had my fingers crossed after ordering this phone from Amazon. Amazon once again proved its customer friendliness, I received it next day of my ordering itself. Kudos to Amazon on its express delivery. You made me exciting once again.Let's come to the main point, my MOTO G4, I can describe in one sentence, ITS A MOTO PHONE, what else does it need for one to get convinced. Don't think I am a crazy fan of MOTO. Truly to say that is the feel I have got from this phone, when I hold it for the first time. It's only my second MOTO phone after my MOTO Razr long ago. Am currently using ASUS Zenfone 5, the early variant, which is still solid and performing, but lacking in meeting my ever growing demands.After I read each of the comments provided here, I have understood many misunderstood or simply scared and returned the phone. So wanted to give a clear review to help others make a clear decision rather buying and suffering it.This phone is not for everyone. So please understand your needs and check whether this phone suits you. Don't just look at configuration and features alone and buy it.DESIGN &amp; BUILD QUALITY: 8/10The design is mixed still being MOTOish mostly, with some transforms, not sure whether it's influenced by Lenovo a little. Rounded corners, MOTO logo in a recessed circle, centred audio jack, curvish trims at top, all are in regular MOTO design language, but flat back, front button kind of look for FP sensor are new. One can easily identify it as MOTO from a distance. So no worries for MOTO lovers.Phone is slightly big for its 5.5 screen, 71% screen ratio, but it could have been slightly trimmed across the corners as it has rounded metal trims all around for support. Yes, it's metal only, not plastic. So it's good and comfortable in larger hands, but people using smaller phones, especially ladies need to think twice.Screen is protected by Gorilla glass, nicely fit around the corners with no gaps or any irregularities, I heard that Redmi N3 has some problem. Touch is responsive and smooth. Front speaker at the top is a sensible design, no worries about call ringtones being muffled anymore as in back speakers when put in bed or any soft surface. My ZENFONE has this drawback, and even RN3 has that issue. Hats off MOTO.Many raised concerns about finger print sensor at front. But this position is what truly ergonomic and practical to use. It's sensibly placed for our thumb in holding hand, or our index finger in other hand, these two fingers only we used 99 percent of the time for operating the touch phone. Apple iPhone designers are no idiots to place it at front. The fact about many putting sensor at the back is not because it's convenient, but it's cheaper and easier to place it there. Otherwise, they need to worry about real estate in front side to place it or change their home buttons as sensors, which cost them a lot, only Apple can afford it. MOTO made a wise and balancing decision here, but obviously it may confuse people for home button for sometime till they get used to. But I would say any new design will take some time to adapt.Flat back is little uncomfortable to hold, again for small hands, but it's rubbery and giving good grip, the metal trims is slippery especially when you have wet hands. It's better to put a silicone cover on it. This is the main reason I hate metal body in phones unless it's micro brushed as in iPhone. Also metal body will be prone to scratches and not replaceable. Though it looked premium in initial days but would become more ugly after some time with all its scratches and dents. iPhone and HTC use military grade titanium alloy, but I doubt about these budget phones with metal body just for the sake to look premium. MOTO didn't compromise on that, kudos again. Only flip side on plastic back though is that, it cannot dissipate heat as good as metal. This is one reason we feel heat on this phone more easily, even though RN3 produce same level of heat. Also flat back makes the phone more slimmer and less bulky, which is good.Overall, phone is very solid and decent looking, not plasticky as told by some people. Very sensible design by MOTO.Who should think twice to buy it?People who thinks metal body as premium statementPeople having smaller hands or using small phones currentlyWhy 8/10?MOTO should have been given a 5 inch version as wellCamera is raised and so prone to scratchesCALL QUALITY and DATA: 9/10MOTO proved solid in calls and networks department once again, no drops. Voice quality is crisp and clear on both ends, thanks to the noise cancelling dual microphone. Calls in given headset is ok, but not great. I understand the headset is the problem, when I switch to my Klipsch, it becomes amazing. Both 3G and 4g works without any flaws. This supports VoLTE, and uses CAT 7 radio that allows phone to download at 300 Mbps at max, thanks to new Snapdragon 617. So future proof in this department.Who can be benefitted:Reliance JIO users, and people who use phone calls and data more regularly or for official purposeCAMERA: 9/10DXOMark rated this camera as 84 which is equal to iPhone 6S plus, even iPhone 6s is having lower rating than this. Believe it or not, only 4 mobile cameras in the world is having better DXOMark rating than this, but they are all flagship models from Samsung and HTC. Though it was tested in controlled environment, regular user experience will be different obviously. But this phone camera is truly best in class, produced similar if not better results in day light photos as iPhone 6. Auto focus is snappy thanks to the laser focus and it's as quick as SLR camera. Though it struggles in low light and indoors, obvious due to pixel in image sensor is smaller as being 16 mp. You can understand why Apple sticks at 12 MP thanks to its larger pixel for excellent low light photos. It would have been great if MOTO sticks at 13 mp itself with its improved top class hardware. Front camera is good but not great, but wider angle helps group selfies much better. Again sensible feature. Camera app is great with its pro mode, worthy to use.Who should think twice?People who takes indoor photos and low light photos very oftenSerious selfie fansI put 9/10, because it misses optical stabilisation, but can understand budget issue there.HARDWARE and SENSORS: 7/10Snapdragon 617...culprit for all those heating....though it has very advanced features under the hood. It's a hybrid processor having 4 cores running at 1.5 ghz to handle heavy job and 4 cores running at 1.2 ghz to handle lighter work and save the battery. Clever design, though it gets heated up easily and throttle down during heating to avoid damaging the phone. So only some slowness while heating. Since it's a newer processor, the OS is not yet fully optimised for it, and I believe future updates will solve this. But again, I tested the temperature under heavy load, it's not that alarming as some people claims here, obviously no iron box or oven, that's too much :) may be you guys need a/c or refrigerator in your phones :)All mid segment SD based phones have heating issue, RN3 has it, HTC has it. High end phones have better heat management design, that cannot be afforded in budget phones. Though SD 617 supports Wifi ac band, this phone sadly supported only b/g/n. Not sure why, so no future proof here. Also no magnetic sensor, many apps rely on this cannot be used on this phone, sad again. But want to clarify one thing, this does not stop you from using maps. Maps work with GPS and your mobile data, so no worries. All the problem with maps is it will not rotate the map when you turn yourself while you walk, but it will turn if you travel in a car using your mobile data as you move faster. Finger print sensor is snappy and accurate and it supports 360 degrees, top class!Who should think twice?People who need icy cool phonesPeople who goes for trekking oftenPeople who rely on compass for their prayer directionsWhy 7/10?No Wifi ac, no compass sensor and non optimised os for heat prone SD 617ACCESSORIES AND BATTERY: 9/10Turbo charging is possible on this phone and improved compared to previous models again thanks to SD 617 for its QuickCharge 3.0 technology. It charged my phone from 50 to 100 in 30 mins. Yet to check the time from 0 to 100. Great for frequent travellers and business people. This unit comes with a turbo charger, that is awesome as MOTO G4 model has no charger included, this charger alone costs around 2000 rupees. Great offer.3000mah battery is much sufficient and balanced for typical phone users, although not for gamers. SD 617 is low power consumer, so no issues.The weakest part is its headphone. Possibly MOTO can avoid putting a headphone altogether rather putting this one. Bad move. Ok for calls, but pathetic for music. My Klipsch rescued me from this. Thank god.Who should think twice?Serious mobile gamers, please go for RN3 with its more powerful processor and larger battery.Why 9/10?Headphones, obviously :)SOFTWARE: 10/10Nothing can beat stock android and its fluid experience. Though I am great lover of ASUS ZenUI (the most sensible custom ROM in my opinion), I loved this vanilla android. Also there are great advantages, as we know quick updates, security patches and high security as custom ROMs open many security loop holes. And it's Marshmallow and it's material theme, awesome experience.I installed some apps from my Zen Ui though, example gallery. We have that freedom to install what we only need, no more bloat wares.Who need to think twice?People who love customisationPeople who don't understand or prioritise securityOverall, if you are one of the following, I better recommend not to buy thisSerious gamers to play heavy games or 3D games, go for RN3People who use it for chatting for hours, go for Mediatek based mobiles, which are slow performers and so less heat.People who want their phone look like iPhone, go for RN3 or Letv or MeizuWho can buy this?Who has more official commitments with this phoneWho appreciates sensible and usable designWho needs a solid service support on a longer runSerious photographers or blogistsEdit:I have found few interesting things on this phone.This phone has a pedometer, I mean step counter, though it's not mentioned anywhere.Likewise it has a rear proximity sensor as well.I tested both these sensors and both work perfectly. If you install CPU-Z, you can reveal these.Also, it keeps two speedy cores shut down during normal usage ensuring power save. Even after I installed and used so many applications, the memory was kept at 50% only. Marshmallow Doze feature helping this perfectly."
1.0 , 15 June 2016,"Moto G plus was my first purchase from Amazon. And I was provided with a defective piece. The speaker of the phone was not working properly. It gets mute even being in general profile and nothing can be heard while calling. So i returned and replaced the phone. But i was provided with the same phone again having the same trouble. Even the seal of the pack was also broken. I vl not blame Moto for this. The phone is excellent n factory defect may sometimes happen. But i am disappointed with Amazon and its poor service. Now i am about to return  it again. And i am worried this time about how much i need to suffer more for refund of the money. My first purchase from Amazon became my last purchase. M not going to make any purchases from Amazon in near future."

1.0 , 4 June 2016,"Phone is going very hot during use"
5.0 , 3 June 2016,"After 2 years with my Moto E 1st Gen, the 4 GB internal storage had become insufficient. Therefore, I was out looking for a new phone which will last me atleast another 4 years, and then I came across this 'wonder device'! The Moto G4 Plus is by far the best phone I have seen and used in a long time, and there are many reasons for me to call it so. I've reviewed each and every aspect of this device in detail below, so this is going to be a long one.1. The DisplayYou would've already read the specs sheet, but still to recap, the phone comes with a 5.5 inch Full HD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The clarity of the display is simply awesome, and better than many other devices I have used. Full HD YouTube videos look just wonderful on this large display. I think 5 to 5.5 inches is the sweet spot for every smartphone. I feel that the display is well protected and will not need any screen protector or scratch guard, though that is totally your choice.2. The InternalsJust to recap again, the phone runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 octa-core processor clocked at 1.5 Ghz. I have purchased the 3 GB RAM + 32 GB Internal Storage variant. For the non-geeks, this means that the device will be a beast and perform optimal in all kinds of situations, including games. It has a dedicated Adreno 405 GPU for good graphics performance. And, with the 32 GB variant, you can be sure that you will not run out of storage space soon.3. The CameraThis is the highlight everyone has been talking about this phone. The phone has a 16 MP primary camera at the back with laser auto-focus and dual LED flash. The front selfie camera is a 5 MP one. The back camera is simply best of its class, and performs much better than many other phones out there. The laser autofocus system helps the camera to focus on objects almost instantly, reducing the time taken to click your pictures. The flash works good, and it lit up a whole dark room in the picture. Outdoor and indoor clicks both look wonderfully well, and the camera is pretty much unmatched by any other device of this range. The front camera takes really good selfies, and is a wide-angle one, so you can capture a whole group in one shot. For the front camera, there is no LED flash provided but the display itself acts as a flash when needed. I have attached some photo samples with this review, some photos are cropped for privacy reasons. You can twist the phone twice to switch on the camera.4. The SoftwareThe phone runs an almost stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the screenshot of which I have attached. There are some small tweaks made by Motorola which just make your experience better. There is the Moto app to configure some gestures and actions. Moto has also guaranteed an upgrade to the next version of Android, making the phone future-proof.5. The BatteryThis is a front I am not too happy in. The phone runs on a 3000 mAh battery and supports TurboCharging. The phone comes with a TurboCharger in the box itself, which claims to charge the phone for use of upto 6 hours in 15 minutes, I have tried this, and it does really charge fast. The charger takes around 1 hour 30 minutes to charge from about 5% to 100%, which is pretty impressive. However, the only complaint I have is with the battery. By 7 PM everyday, the battery would already be low at 15% with moderate use during the day. I watch about 30 minutes of YouTube, use the Facebook app for a few minutes, talk for about 5 minutes, play Wynk Music for about an hour and keep the screen brightness to about 80%. But I keep unlocking the screen once every five minutes. Maybe I can vary my usage pattern and get more performance from the battery.6. The Fingerprint sensorThe fingerprint sensor works like a charm, unlocks my phone almost instantly. Do note that with too many failed fingerprint unlock attempts, you may need to use your alternative unlock option. I have 3 fingerprints setup and they all work fine all the time. One tip I would suggest is: If you keep your phone in your left pocket, avoid configuring the left thumb to unlock and vice versa. This is because the phone might unlock automatically as you will use your thumb to pull out your phone from your pant.7. The speakerThe phone has a single speaker that also acts as an earpiece for calls. The speaker is not too loud, and delivers sound in pretty much the same quality as other phones. If you constantly listen to music with your phone, you may need to look elsewhere or buy a good set of earphones. As usual, the earphones provided in the box are the regular hard ones and not so comfortable. However, the sound quality is pretty good, in-par with other phones.8. The Colours and the LooksThe phone comes in black and white colours. I feel that the White colour looks really nice. Being so used to seeing black phones everywhere, I am actually happy buying a white phone. The back is texturized, giving a good grip to hold the phone. The sides are metal and look very premium. Even the buttons look really good this time, and are tactile-enough for normal use. There is no option to buy official colour back covers, but you can get them from other manufacturers.9. Connectivity and Expandable StorageThe phone has a dual-SIM option, with one SIM slot supporting 4G and the other 3G. I personally don't like the concept of dual SIM, and use a single Airtel SIM. The call quality is good and both parties can hear the conversation clearly. The phone is capable of 4G speeds, and it works fine with Airtel's 4G networks in Bangalore.The phone comes with upto 128GB of expandable storage. It is recommended to use a high-speed UHS-1 microSD card. I use a 32 GB Sandisk card, and it is working pretty fine. I used to face problems with high-speed cards in the Moto E, but it doesn't happen here. One interesting feature I noticed is that you can format your microSD card as 'Portable Storage' meaning you can use it with any other device you want, or fornat as 'Device Storage' that locks the card to this device and makes it work as internal device stoage itself! I formatted it this way, and now have 64 GB internal memory to store all my apps, pictures and data!10. Heating?I have noticed people complaining about the device getting heated up. Yes, I have noticed it too and it is becoming normal with all phones these days. It is not getting too hot, just a little warm at the back with extended usage, but it cools down after a while. Hey, you are buying a phone, not an AC! :-)However, I have not tested the phone with graphic-heavy and intensive apps and games. If it does heat up then, it means that the phone is designed for medium usage, not for high-graphic gaming.All in all, I think this phone is really value-for-money and one of the best phones out there. It is guaranteed to last a long time for you, with its powerful hardware and stock Android software. If you are in the market for a phone within 15K, make this your choice and it will definitely be the best choice you ever made!(PS: My longest review!)"

He took this phone for his office purpose and now when the clients call him he is unable to communicate with them properly. Now the second phone which i am using is also having small clarity problem when on calls. The headset coming with this phone is also having problems. So now we have decided to return both phones and ask for a refund.Bad luck that we have to face this problem."

5.0 , 29 May 2016,"I'm gonna write a review about the moto g4 plus will keep on updating it, if you find the review helpful please click the helpful button below.So i received this phone yesterday after ordering it on 22 may. Pathetic delivery though i understand the high demand makes it complicated.Build and Design 9/10The build quality is amazing, i know many people will like a metal chassis but come on the plastic doesn't feel cheap, instead the metal body gets more prone to heating, the design is amazing as i like the fingerprint scanner to be placed on the front not all people will like it there but you know perspectives differ. The mobile feels quite light and premium though the protruding camera is quite prone to scratches.Display 10/10The display is brilliant, the colours are crisp the viewing angles are quite good, the touch feels buttery smooth. The touch is quite responsive and as some reported it doesn't heat up that much I've been using it for 5-6 hours continously but it didn't heat up. Plus you also get a update stating camera stability and stability something which really helped. The Speakers as the compared to the moto g3 aren't up to the mark but are okay as nobody wants a portable music system out of a mobile phoneSoftware 9/10 Nobody can get android better than moto and Nexus devices the bloarware free stock Android experience is great and a treat to the eyes. My used ram remains below 1 gb when idle. The software doesn't lags. And the working is smoothBattery 8/10 The battery life is decent and lasts upto 6-7 hours on continuous gaming or 3g usage and lasts upto a day on normal usage, the battery gets charged up in 1.40 hours.Camera 10/10Now I'm a moto fan boy but a thing that disappointed me every time in a moto device was the camera but now they've improved it so much that I'm loving it, it is hands down the best camera phone in this budget and one of the best camera phones around the picture quality is great,  the detailing is amazing, and the professional mode oh I'm in love with the professional mode, i haven't tried low licht photography with this will update you ASAPWill update the gaming review soon"
5.0 , 2 June 2016,"I have been using this phone since Saturday, 28th May 2016. Today is 2nd June 2016. I went thru all the reviews on Amazon, youtube, other sites etc. This is the first time that I see that the reviews did not really capture the essence of the phone and were downright wrong in some instances. I was so worried after researching that I almost ordered K4 Note as I was afraid of ordering this phone because of all the bad rap it got. Most common myths surrounding this phone are 1) Overheating, 2) low performance, 3) Low battery life. All the reviews praised the camera and stock android experience. Lets find out what went wrong with these reviews by these so called "geeks".1) Camera - This is the best in class camera that this phone has. Just please ensure to open up the in camera settings and setting the picture quality to 16 MP. Its set to 11 MP by default. I have seen a lot of "heavy users" here on amazon complaining about 11MP pictures. Wont say more as camera is really subjective anyway.2) Performance - Snapdragon 617. Man, is this processor fast. SD617 has eliminated all the shortcomings 615 had. SD615 was so popular because of its midrange performance, but it was so bad because it always overheated even while chatting. I know because I used Mi4i and yureka plus, and both had SD 615. SD 617 coupled with adreno 405 has been tearing apart every game that is available currently. Asphalt 8 works like a charm on the highest settings. Even modern combat 5 (not my taste of game, but tested it anyway to check the horsepower) ran fluid. I never installed any benchmark tools, coz they seldom tell you the real world performance and put a number on performance and treat it like end of the worls. No sir, I dont trust them, I dont use them. The most graphically intense game that I know is modern combat 5 and it ran like a charm. If you know any other game that may challenge this, please let me know. I will install it and run it and check out the performance for you. Batman arkham origins (another game I did not like) was running fine before I uninstalled it. All in all, unreal engine based games are running very nicely3)Overheating - Guys, let me tell you, this is a myth. Whoever is claiming that the phone overheats at any point except charging is either smoking crack (you should pass it to me please, coz it seems like gud stuff) or is trying to invite aliens to earth in some god foresaken ritual practiced on the phone. No it doesnt fry my eggs, it doesn't blister my fingers, it doesn't even let me feel the heat. In my room, the temperature reported by CPUz are 39 degrees at idle and 42 degrees at full load. The temperature is of the back panel and full load means constant gaming for 2 hours of the aforementioned games. If this is a problem for anybody, they should probably not buy any phone except above 30K (if even that). Although I wish, it would fry my eggs, ya know.. :p. For reference, yureka plus sits at around 40 at idle and reaches 53 (YES 53) after 10 minutes of gaming, or 30 minutes of whatsapp. Please keep in mind that the phone WILL heat when you charge it with the supplied turbo charger, but it is designed to do this. Normal chargers, car chargers etc. doesnt cause this phone to heat4) Battery - THIS is where I am most impressed after 3rd point. The battery lasts about 12 hours with moderate to heavy usage. Okay, check this out. I go to work in the cab which take me about an hour, hour and a half to reach. I watched HD videos (local) on the first day for this time. Then at the office also, I kept tinkering with it. (cant blame me, the phone is new after all). I still reached home with 10% battery remaining. On the next day, I listened to music while reading my stuff on the phone. Used it slightly less for tinkering but more for work related calls, I still went home with around 20%. My phone is always on 3G at work. My mobile signal is a mixture of yellow and orange. I find about 2 3 hours of screen on time to do stuff on phone. Inspite of all this, if I am going home with 10-20% battery, I consider myself lucky. Again, battery life is subjective. Everybody has a different mileage. Yesterday, I turbo charged my phone at work. At around 6PM it was at 40%. I charged it to 86% in half an hour and reached home at around 1030PM with 60%. Remember, my screen was always on in the cab with 3G etc. on.5) Finger print sensor - I am using FP sensor on my phone for the first time. I am blown away. I dont know if it works faster than iPhone or any other phone or not, nor do I give a rat's hairy ass. I know my sensor works and it works so good that I will never be able to buy a phone or a tablet without it. Silly people are complaining about its placement, but you know what, its THE most sensible place to put a sensor at. Try using it in the phones that have it at the back and you will know. Plus, when you have any application that is full screen (videos, games, pdf mostly), touching this button brings up the onscreen controls. You will really appreciate this when you are watching a video on mx player and try to bring down the notification panel by touching the top of the phone, and end up lowering the volume, hehe. Its also very fast. It unlocks my phone right from the dark screen to home screen in less than a blink. Cant live without it anymore. I know I am spoiled.Cons - It is difficult to find cons with this device. But there are some. Lack of notification light.Also, the fact that it doesn't make my coffee, does not give me pleasure in my nether areas, and does not summon aliens when I want. Apart from this, AMAZING PHONE. Dont pay heed to these negative reviewers and go buy this phone. They are spoiled kids comparing this phone with phones that are much further in the food chain. Really not fair. All the best."

4.0 , 15 June 2016,"Everything is ok about RAM,  ROM,  battery backup, camera, touch, lightweight, good looks, speaker.  But the simple things you cannot change the UI style like other Android phones where we can change the style or size of icons,Group them within menu,effects, but this all are not present in this phone.  Even u cannot remove Google search widget from the homepage.  Obviously this are ignorable things but Motorola should make these users controllable... Battery percentage is not available to display at screen level but have after putting the drop down menu even you can't add or change anything on the drop down menu... UI is not so standard or hitech just simple... May b Redmi Note 3 will be better than this Motorola G4 phone in all those unavailable things...."

5.0 , 16 June 2016,"The best sub 15k handset by far. Saw a lot of people raving about the MI3 being better than this, but honestly the G4 Plus is at par if not better.The performance is lag free.Have tried playing 3 games simultaneously but the handset does not get as heated up as the Mi3. The camera, amazingly gives the iphone 6s a run for its money and the battery life is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!Saw an entire season of Man vs Food on YouTube with the phone fully charged and with the speakers on full volume. After finishing 12 b2b episodes, the battery still remained at 28 per cent.The phone does heat up during turbo charging, but I guess thats what turbo charging is all about.Absolutely recommended!"
5.0 , 15 June 2016,"Not technically expert though.The Finger lock system is awesome, it opens very fast, faster than other top brand(I phone) and Compared open/run application with other brand and it just got faster. Screen flash option is what I did not expected as inclusion, even though it is bit lack in quality.  Sound quality is excellent for call, but for listening music it is not upto expectation. Resolution is brilliant as as MOTO is always.Design of Finger lock  looks out of fashion, and it feels like a hard button, wish it could be a soft button with MOTO logo,This is it for now, will use for some time and write more next time, planning to get this device one more. Yes. Amazon delivered on time."

5.0 , 23 May 2016,"Update v3.0 : Coming soon.Update v2.0 : Photos uploaded. Device is working great.Really satisfied with the performance and camera.After using is for few days I think the device does get a little warm on usage.But nothing uncomfortable here .Because of the side metal frame,It dissipates the internal heat to outside.So,thats why you little warm.But actually that's good for the device.The battery does get charged really quick.I didn't time it though.Camera is as good as I expected .The low light pics are little noise but the colours are fairly accurate.Battery Life seems good.Lets see in the coming weeks. As said I will update this review regularly .Update V1.0 : iNITIAL REVIEWAnother MOTO created a huge buzz this year,its non other than the new Moto G4 Plus.I have used every moto G phones released to date.My experience with all of them were really satisfying.I bought this on the first sale and received it very late, As there was some transit delay. Anyway I am very happy to get it now atleast.My this review will be focused on first impression only, because I think it's not fair to put on a full review so early.What I like about it-------------------------------UI is almost Stock Android, which I love the most.-No lag at all.-Camera is super awesome, I think its the best in this range. The last auto focus is a killer.And this time it works.-Battery life seems ok. Can't comment much now. Though I haven't noticed any unusual battery draining.-Gets a little warm on usage. Its ok , nothing annoys.-Display is better than the previous moto G's.-Build quality is super. Motorola have long tradition of realise handsets with excellent build quality. This one is no exception.-Some cool features are there. Like moto display, which will turn on automatically when you take it out of your pocket. And a few more. Will comment later-Front camera takes some really sharp and accurate photos. The camera sensor is a wide angle one.-Speakers have nice sound output, though not the best.-I played few games like asphalt 8, real racing, dream league soccer, mini militia and more. Everything worked without any lag. Intact my gaming experience was very loving.-It feels really comfortable to hold In landscape mode. The sides are rounded and are smooth. Helps while gaming.-Finger print works flawlessly. No complains.- and much more to discover.What I don't like.--------------------------Note : personal opinion.-didn't like the finger print style. Its different and unique but looks a bit awkward. Who knows if gets the trend in the future.-No water proof certification. Some people do buy phones because they what it to be the most durable and waterproof of course.-nothing much as of now.As said I will be updating the full review after using it for a couple of days.Thanks, I hope I was helpful."

Battery will last a day at max for normal usage with 4G on whole day.5. No call drops, 4G is faster than my wifi.6. More than 1.5 gb Ram is already used by system apps. So slightly more than 1gb is available for gaming and other usage7. Modern combat 5 game got stuck while playing for about a min or so.Finally if u not a gaming person...chances r that u will like this mobile"
4.0 , 23 May 2016,"After reading few reviews of heating problem, i was quite disappointed from first though i got my phone delivery today &amp; after using it whole day long am writing this review,Heating problem is quite desirable if u live in hot region like East Indian states or any other hot region because of atmosphere,,Coming to the phone, the main cons on inside of it-1. Finger sensor do not work as back home button key.2. No gallery option in menu.3. No OTG cable, fast charger is one single cable.4. Loud speaker not too good.Some pice of phone attached with review."
5.0 , 28 May 2016,"I am writing this review after three days of my purchase of moto g4 plus. Firstly i would like to thank amazon for their quick service. :)..Now coming on the topic, i wud like to share my honest views on the moto g4 plus. I purchased this phone after reading almost all reviews of amazon.com. Like every one i was into a mix feeling of buying or not buying this mobile. The thought of mobile getting over heated and other negative reviews made me very confused. I would like to say to each and every one reading my review that this moto g4 plus is a perfectly normal mobile with no heating issues whatsoever. It just gets little warm during turbo charging which is absolutely normal with any snal dragon mobile. The camera quality is really good, colors r vibrant and no blurry or shaky image, one thing that disappointed me a little is the time taken for turbo charging. It takes approx 1 percent/1 min. So the phone takes approx 1 hour and 40 mins to get charge fully. The battery back up is pretty much decent. I charged my phone to 100% at 10:14 am and after heavy use which included camera utilization and continuous mobile data on, its 35% at 9:27 pm, which shows the battery back up is excellent :), the front camera is good. I swtiched from s4 to moto g4 plus and i have no regrets..I recommend this mobile to those who want a long lasting battery, good for heavy games, photography lovers. The call quality is good but samsung s4 is better :) .Over all performance is a treat with no lags and hangs. Thanks for reading my reviews..i hope u like my reviews :)"

4.0 , 27 May 2016,"Hello friends,It's being 5 days since I'm using this handset as on today (27th May 16). For me it's first time I switchedover to some other brand than Samsung. Few points to be highlighted..Pros:No need to mention as this device has got most of the things available &amp; tried their level best to offer at this price range.Few shortcomings as per my usage would like to highlight:1) Device doesn't have MHL. So you can't connect your mobile with your smart TV to access the pictures or videos of this mobile.2) You can't share your screen with your smart TV. U may try with third party app. However I tried with Google Cast but it doesn't support.3) You can't use your mobile as TV or Set Top Box remote as there is no Infrared Sensor.4) Slightly heating problem while charging but that is avoidable. It happens with almost all the smart phones I believe.5) Space bar is not smooth while typing messages. Which is very irritating.6) Turbo Charger takes 1 hr 45 min to fully charge the battery from 20% to 100%.7) I'm not game addict &amp; don't play games in mobile. But battery drains to 50% only in 6 hrs of normal usage like few callings, FB, WhatsApp &amp; very nominal web browsing. So don't have very high hopes from 3000mAh battery.8) Screen is not AMOLED."
5.0 , 1 June 2016,"I've purchased Moto g4 plus 32gb variant and have been using this phone for past 8 days.I would keep this simple by addressing those things what ppl have been asking for.Heating issue- the phone get heats up while turbo charging and after intense use of camera and gaming apps. This is quite normal for any smartphone. I honestly say, you can ignore this. No need of zooming this issue.Camera- both front and rear cameras perform well. For ppl who are photo enthusiasts this is the best phone in this budget range.Battery- i am a normal user and don't play much games, so I'm getting good battery life. Big thanks to turbo charger!! 0-100% charging is done in 75-85 min.Remaining aspects like build quality, screen, sound etc as such you might have already known about all those. So i won't touch them.Overall, Moto g4 plus is value for money. Don't think twice. Go get it soon. This is my first Moto phone and I'm loving it.Just one sentence, clear winner in this budget range. Go for it."

The Laser focus works well.Low light photos are not best but its above average its quite good.But In daylight it clicks awesome photos.And the 5MP front camera also clicks some fine shots.And the phone has some heating issue.Its got heated a bit more then the average smart phone.Recorded temperature was about 40 degree celcius on playing games like nova.Talked about the heating problem with moto customer support they said its normal with this phone when using heavy apps or talking on phone for extensive hours or when using camera for long time or using phone while charging.They also said that if the phone got heated beyond 45 degree thn please contact to the customer support.But the temperature never crossed this mark till now when using my phone.And also phone doesn't have any dedicated gallery app in the menuthe google photos is given to view your device's photos or video.In this range moto delivers a quite good device.The Box contains the device,a turbo charger and a earphone."
5.0 , 30 May 2016,"Great phone and very good value for money. Have been using it for a week now and no major complaints thus far. There's a bit of heating while playing games or turbo-charging of course but nothing alarming to worry about. I really love the stock android that we don't get anywhere other than nexus. Display is bright and clear  and camera is pretty decent too, but not so much as promised. Finger print scanner works flawlessly and really fast. There is also no lag whatsoever. If  you are not a serious gamer, I think you can just go for it."

5.0 , 1 June 2016,"I have used it for a week or so !! To be honest I will explain it in terms of the pros and cons in detail !!The PROs:1. Very good display . Images are sharp and colors are great! Full HD at its best!2. The camera is stunning . The laser auto focus does its job too well . The HDR mode gets u the pictures with great details! The front camera is also good .I have added the pictures see it3. Graphics and processing is also good as far as I have used it runs all the games pretty well !4 . The Design is always the best when it comes to moto . The white coloured version doesn't absorb dirt as compared to the Moto g3 .5 . The fingerprint sensor it the best . Reacts immediately . and identifies in any angle u place the finger .6 . Call quality is good the mics are placed perfectly .7 . The speaker has good volume controls and better sound.8. The pure Android marshmallow 6.0.1 runs smooth without any flaws. U will surely love the smoothness. It comes with many new options like gestures and moto display. Etc...9. Faster Charing with Turbo charge 25 . u get full charge in an hour or so !10. More memory for more apps .. I suggest u go for the 32 GB model with 3 GB RAM ..The CONs :1. Too much heating on even a normal use and while charging .. I guess the future updates will rectify this .2. The  3000 mah battery doesn't perform that well .That's it people .. It is a best buy under 15k category! Moto is a trusted brand . I have used all the versions of moto g's and this is the best go for it .ThanksAny questions comment below"
4.0 , 30 May 2016,"Review in short,  for detailed review continue reading till endPros:1 good design and better build quality not the best and yes the fastest fingerprint sensor i have seen2 exceptional superfast camera3 great battery life4 turbo charger is a delight to have it goes from 20 to 60 within 20 to 30 mins mins5 gorgeous dispaly6 feels very light weight in hand7 3gb ram plus 32gb rom and a octa processor due to this combination the phone is blazingly fast and pure android is icing over cake no lag at allCons:1 moto has not done RnD on thermal, it heats a little but thats bearable compared to metal body2 in box headphones are average3 motorola swapped the data cable for turbo charger so there is no separate usb cable.Keep reading for my personal detailed review after a week of usage others dont waste time and just go for it the cons are bearable for the features it gives.DETAILED REVIEW1) BUILD QUALITY AND DESIGN 4/5Its plastic body something feel like metal around the frame, personally i dont like metal body as they are slippery i prefer comfort over style but its not good as moto x play but overall its more than good,2) FINGERPRINT SENSOR 5/5Conviniently located and amazingly fast perhaps the best, it recognizes your fingerprint from any angel and till now it never failed and recognized my fingerprint every time woww and the best part you can unlock it when the screen is off unlike iphone where you need to press the home button first.3) DISPLAY 5/55.5 inch screen with FHD makes it worth looking at it again and again crisp and clear clarity delight to watch videos great moto has upgraded from hd to fhd that's all done and dusted related to dispaly and its awesome4) PERFORMANCE 4.5/5Android updates 5/5I don't beleive in high specs rather i beleive in user experience, the specs are more than enough to handel day to day task with snapdragon octa core 617 n 3gb of ram this phone almost handels everything you through at it and muti tasking is a breeze apps open instantly and no lag at all so its a butter smooth performance and best part you get next 2 updates of Android of Android N and O and i trust moto on this as it upated moto e to lolipop and beleive me you will love the pure android interface just one thing i did not like about it moto replaced the gallery app with google photos which i did not like i have upgraded from moto e to g 4 plus the gallery app of moto is very useful. In this dept there is one drawback that after using gps or 15 to 20 mins of continuous usage of gaming or when downloading n installing many apps the phone gets a little warm but that's bearable and nothing to complain about it as this is normal. Coming to gaming i am not a big fan but it plays games like blood and glory 2 with ease and doesn't lag or frames drop so it will handel average games.5) Camera 16mp + 5mp 4/5The phones focuses and captures instantly thanks to two auto focus technology pdaf and laser auto focus for this reason it feels great to take pictures in it, daylight performance is fantastic and low light performance is more than good not the best well thats ok after all flagship phones are 2 times more costlier. Coming to front camera its more than enough for normal people if you are selfie lover go for some special selfie phone, the selfies i took were detailed and wide angel lense lets you to take more people in the frame. One thing moto has given overhaul to the camera app it has moved from basic to advanced and it also has pro mode to play with settings such as iso, white balance, exposure you feel like a pro :)6)CONNECTIVITY 4.5/5The phone has dedicated two macro sim slots and a memory card so you dont need to play the hybrid game here and after all this the phone is still slim. It has 4g lte and supports volte, it lacks nfc but i think nfc in india will take years to be used as technology for contact less payments n other features, all said it has all other basic connectivity.7)BATTERY LIFE AND CHARGING 5/5You may think 3000 mah battery is less for a 5.5 inch fhd phone but the os is optimized and for and average user like me it goes for more than a day, even if your usage is heavy it will last a full day and if you need more gaming n heavy usage dont worry turbo charger has your back you can full charge your phone in an hour. Moto says 90 mins but mine got charged to 100 in 1 hour almost every time. This is one hell of a feature u will love and the phone was exceptional right from when i opened it. At the first boot it had 67% battery then i switched my apps from old to new phone using Google setup and it started downloading over 20 apps over wifi along with synchronization and the next morning the battery was still at 20% this shows how well os is optimized.Verdict 9/10This phone you can say is best in moto g series when compared to moto g 3 it lacks curves and waterproof feature but its more sleek and flat design that makes it slim.The phone ticks all the right boxes with great display, good battery life, turbo charger, awesome camera and good build quality these are the basic things a phone should have, if you want more raw power i will suggest go with mi note 3 it has metal build snapdragon 650 which is 40% more powerful but if you are little over average user with social networking, browsing and little gaming and watching few videos then at this price 15k this phone is all you need. Just go for ittIf you liked my review plese mark it as helpful.Thanks."

My daily usage is like 1-2 hrs of phone and whatsapp and FB..No usage issues at all. No heating issue at all. Yes may be when u play games it does. I read other mobile reviews before buying and all phones have heating issue. Turbo charge is awesome. Battery lasts for 1 days. Morning 8 AM full charge and at 9-10 PM 40% will be left for me.. Worth a buy in this range."

Even while charging tge phone heats up. It doesnt have gallery we have to download. The other thing is when we open file manager the photos while opening take  a bit of time, which was Not an issue  with my earlier sony xperia phones.

Now, everytime I put it on charge, it shows "charging slowly" or "X hours to full charge" where X sometimes is as big as 24 hours and usually 6 hours.I called Amazon and they said, they cannot replace it as seller now doesn't have this phone available and so I have to return and order new one.Yesterday I returned my phone. and today I am going to again order this phone with fingers crossed. Will comeback to review after 2 weeks or so."
3.0 , 23 May 2016,"Hai there, i Booked a Moto G4 as soon as it went on sale, and also went with a one day delivery, hence i got the phone exactly 17hrs since sale started.Note: pls reffer else where for features of the phone(its easy to find, i would only share the usage details and not bore u with features of the phone)Now coming back to my personal review of the phone based on Usage since 5 daysIts a good phone over all. but not worth it i feel, i expected much more from moto1)Display is good AND feel of the phone is good. little hard to use in one hand, still i love big screen phones.2)FingerPrint sensor is the best, very fast n responsive, works for other apps as well such as app locks etc(which is awesome)ppl complaint about moto placing the sensor in front unlike other phone in rear, but trust me, its more easy to use in front rather than rear under regular and normal usage. Thanks to moto design.3)Battery back up is bad as per me, i get hardly 10 to 12 hours on normal usage under wifi usage.i have not used mobile data so far, i should be less than wifi for sure4)thanks to turbo charging, the phone charges really fast, hence above complaint about battery backup can be ignored, 10% to 100% in just 1 hour even less4) Camera is simply mind blowing, its worth 15k5) storage is good, 32 gb worth the cash6) 3 gb ram is more than sufficient for this phone, never laged so far in terms of memory management.7) Processor is bad, my phone freezed and restarted 2 times from past 5 days since it would not bare the load, i am worried what about further usage, since i game a lot.8) Game play is good but not Great, dint lag so far9) the worst of all above points is the heating issue, phone heats like hell, specially when u play games and reco ,rd video in full hd.i think i have covered most of the points under normal usage..in shortGOOD-Camera, Finger Print sensor,Turbo Charging, Display, 3 gb Ram, Storage 32 gb inbuilt plus expandable 128, Dual Sim, Pure Android OS for Smooth Usage.(No junk apps by stock )BAD- Processor, Battery, Heating Issue.thanks"
4.0 , 12 June 2016,"Awesome camera.No lags.calling quality Is average.overall superb in this price range but what makes the downfall to it is its heating problem.Its temperature rises rapidly outside jst after clicking some pictures or using net and the camera then takes 1 to 2 mins to a single shot.So I have returned it.But if you can compromise the heating then its a reliable mobile in this price range and also the fingerprint does not miss a single attempt and detects the finger from every angle."
4.0 , 7 June 2016,"I ve been using the mobile since a months time, up till now it seems to b too good in that price.Before purchasing i have seen no of reviews and comparisons, as said yes there is a heating problem at the speaker and surrounding area to the camera but it cools down very fast, this heating problem is quiet common in all most all the smart phones with these features.the camera quality is pretty good. Good to go product, hope for the same performance in near future too."
5.0 , 28 May 2016,"I was almost going to cancel the order after all the negative reviews but i am glad i did not. Here is what i thinkNo over heating issue - i have not experianced any overheating so far .  while charging intially it gets warm but not hot. 30 mins into it and the phone remains cool for the rest of the charging period. I downloaded almost 1gb data over wifi and it did not heatup. For most parts it did not even get warm. Same thing for long hours of chatting , browsing, music etc. So far i have not noticed any heating , hanging, throttling at all with normal use. It gets warm while using camera and gaming but not a lot. I clicked pictures, shot normal and slowmotion videos of about 3-5 mins  and it did get warm but it did not affect the performance. Normal users need not worryI think people also confuse getting warm with actual overheating issue  . For that watch digital guruji video on heating and overheating smartphones on youtube .Looks and feel- awesomeBuild - good , the volume and power button could have been a bit less rigid.Software - amazing optimization and it will only get better with updates . Stock android feels great. Got an update immediately and may be that solved the heating issue.really fast and smart use of hardware.( this is where it is better that xiome and the rest)Camera - the best. All the features are great and really fast auto focus . Slowmotion videos , panorama , hdr perform really well even in low lightCall quality - very good , no call drops or noise.Display - excellent. Adaptive brightness feature works flawlesslyBattery - with a wifi always on and heavy downloading , browsing, chatting, facebook ,And moderate camera usage and gamingThe battery lasted for 12 hours. And with normal use it went for 24 hrs. 8 hrs standby at night and i lost only 4% battery. Wifi was off. Turbo charger charged it from 0 to100% in 100 mins .And in 15 mins it charges 20 % which is really handy.Fingerprint unlock  - 100 % accurate and fastMoto features like gestures for camera , flash light, and others are more useful than i thought.This phone is good for1) heavy wifi internet users ( i have not tested it with mobile data)2) Photography enthusiasts3) people wanting reliability and brand value4) people wanting stock android and quick updatesStay away if you are1) heavy game userI hope this review helps. I will upload update to this if i face any problem. But as of now i am loving it .Update 1.0 - 3g data will hog up your battery more"
5.0 , 12 June 2016,"Best phone under 15k. The heating issues are gone after the OTA update. I have played games for more than an hour it barely heated. Fingerprint scanner is quick. Front camera is the best for large group selfies due to wide angle.Built looks premium and it's quiet lightweight. Also the Turbo charging is quick for instant battery backup.There are lot of negative views about the product but I feel it's the best stock Android phone you can get under 15k."
5.0 , 7 June 2016,"I was looking for a 3 or 4 GB RAM phone with android marshmallow, 32 GB storage expandable or more, a fast processor and a good battery and a good camera. Price was important too. I could not have asked for more for a price of  15,000. I have had no problems with the set with 15 days usage. It has fingerprint software too. Only irritating thing is that the time comes on at the slightest shake of the set, particularly as I travel a lot. I have not been able to put it off."

3.0 , 12 June 2016,"Best thing about the phone is its camera when compare to th other mobile  in this price  segemnt.Mobile is heats up within a few minute of usage.In this lrice segment lenovo would have given more powerfull processor and metal body even though  the moto g 4 dnt look bad.Lenovo would have also given  water resistent  capability.Moto g4 is a good mobile for day today usage with prompt update  but it is priced more than it deserve."
4.0 , 11 June 2016,"The phone is very good and responsive . Yes all the heating problem that everyone is talking about is there , but it is very normal for almost all the phones .So I feel the heating problem should not bother you . Speaking of the size ,it's 5.5 inc which is a bit big ,especially for females . I ordered it for my wife and she having trouble handling it. 5 inch would have made it easier and sleeker . The built quality is good overall. The best part is the camera ,it really surprises you with quality ,especially when Moto is not known for its camera. Slow motion video are good but don't compare it to Apple . Battery life is good and the turbo charger is the best thing that has ever happened to mankind . My verdict : Buy"

Fast touch lock, Super quality camera, High speed RAM, Automatically updated to Android latest update. One last thing Turbo charger is really game changer!"
4.0 , 1 June 2016,"The phone is really good. Lets talk about battery first as everyone says its becoming hot while using. It is becoming hot while charging. Especially when you connect it with laptop and charge it, it burns. But not while using. Next one is Camera. It is good and clear with several options. Front is also good. Next comes sound. It will not shout and call the crowd. But the user can hear it loud and clear. But headset sucks. If you use it, you will get ear pain and it is not omitting the outside noise while listening songs. You can still hear everything happening around you which is good in some scenarios. Finally the finger print scanner. It is placed in front with a reason. It has the speakers in front. So, you wont keep the phone upside down so that you can hear. So, if you get a message, you dont want to take it on hands to unlock and view the message. All together, the phone is worth buying."

I had ordered a 3GB RAM - 32GB storage variant but they shipped a 2GB RAM - 32GB Storage.Other than this, its a good handset. Good in-hand feel! Camera is great! (the pictures of the box was taken with this phone."
4.0 , 31 May 2016,"Received this mobile yesterday (30th may), Black 32Gb variant, had ordered on 22nd, when it had lot of offers, no complains that it took so many days to reach, as i am from one town in kutch, gujarat, and i didn't select fast delivery. (PS Still waiting to receive those offers)Packaging as usual by amazon was quite good, packing and box of mobile by Lenovo/motorola was very basic, decent enough, that included low quality headphone and super turbo charger, besides manual papers having details of phone in language english and hindi both through which i came to know small but important things about the phone like SAR value and from where and how to open the back side safely etc.couldn't wait to get my hands on the phone anymore, i removed company's screen guard, inserted one sim and memory card to finally turn it on, it went through the set up and within few minutes was ready to use,Mobile feels excellent in the hands but its design gives a very ordinary look that it doesn't seem like a 15K phone, considering its 2016 when even some 10-12k phones give close to premium look, lenovo have made it look more like chinese mobile, they should have retained the old style look of moto which was its distinctive feature anyways its very comfortable in holding,Using it in first half an hour i was absolutely delighted and  glad that i purchased this after going through so many options, though i have used lot of brands of mobiles but i am fan of nexus because of their stock pure raw android, one of reason why i purchased this, and whoa it didnt disappoint me one bit, the latest marshmallow works like a charm, as smooth as it can get. no customized UI, the best experience of android. also the fingerprint works like a premium phones of 40-50K, in first hour i had downloaded and started playing 2-3 games simultaneously with high graphics out of which one was very heavy, again super experience with no lag whatsoever, i had also used Wifi and browsed few websites simultaneously while playing games, multitasking with no problem and worked as good as it can, btw it took time for me to get used to no home button. audio speaker quality is nice for the price, display  too is awesome, no forward button was letdownalso during the above use i could feel mobile was getting warm, not exactly heated but the temperature was constantly increasing, checked the camera too, i am not a pro in photography but what i felt through 2-3pics i clicked that picture quality was great  even for 20k range phones, anyways it was now 50minutes of use, i decided to test the voice through the calls, i made one call and received another, each of 4-5minutes, voice was clear, headset and loudspeaker, no disturbance or anything while talking,But as soon as i was done with the second call, i noticed the mobile has started getting overheated very badly, the warm that i was feeling has turned into a heating, a heating which was far more than normal, after reading lot of reviews about its overheating i had given a second thought to my order a lot, to cancel it, since i hate overheating in the phone, but there were also reviews which said it was normal or no heating also my friends one each in mumbai and bangalore after ordering and using it were positive so in the end i had decided to go with it, hoping that mine wont have over heating problem just like my 2 friends, notice i am ok with phone getting warm or even heated with heavy use, but getting over heating beyond normal is something which i cant stand, that this phone was starting to have it, when you cant even touch the phone, unfortunately for me the fear that i had this with phone turned true,I would like to mention even when phone temperature was rising very fast from heating to over heated to beyond as bad as it can go, but the performance had no lag or there was no slowness or any effect in the working of the mobile, in fact it was working as smooth and while all this battery was going strong, no drain, nothing like that.the phone's heating was so much after 1 hour or so and soon after those 2 calls, that i felt pain/burn in my ear too because of those 2 calls, plus with phone's overheating beyond limit,  i had no option but to leave the mobile from my hands and put it away, i did exactly that before putting app cooler master on download.After about 10 minutes i again got hold on the mobile, its over heating was going down, it was on a way to become normal, at this moment i received one call, which lasted for 5minutes, that  again gave me pain in my ear, kind of heavy burning sensation, i checked the phone temperature through the app, it was 43 degree, (when it looked like it was cooling down) and after  5minutes when its temperature was 40, i  decided to play the game subway surfer, within 12-15minutes again it was reversed to go towards over heating, to the point which i had to again leave it, i checked its temp it was about 48-50. making me highly disappointed.this circle continued with its use it was getting heated badly, upto the point, that you cant hold it, although it also got cooled down quickly when you leave it for few minutes, but it took same minutes for getting heated badly, the most disappointing thing in this was that later i  was having a normal usage, it was all about few calls, and checking twitter. but its temp was constantly rising with normal use too, and should i mention you cant even talk on the phone while its heated without burning your ear.it was dinner time now, my happiness of stock android experience, smooth performance, battery, etc was thrashed by its over heating effects on my ears while on call, so high temp that it can give serious competition to an iron and oven later on with normal use too,i also decided to not receive or make any calls now and use  my other mobiles for that (nexus 5) (samsung s4), at this moment i received an update, it took considerable time to download,it must have got downloaded in 45minutes or so, as per my wifi network speed but i checked it only at late night as i got busy in some work with other mobiles in use, also anyway my excitement was killed because of overheating,so late night i checked the phone and updated the android os  properly, after which i noticed the overheating problem improved by 50-55% not fully though. and at that time 39% battery was still remaining which is excellent.same today morning, the problem of over heating was not as much as yesterday or unlike it was before that update, with modest normal usage mostly today, i went to make a call, but this time also it annoyingly gave me burning sensation in a ear, here i would like to say that all this while i also used samsung s4 and nexus5 for calls which went normally, gave no problem in my ear.overheating problem is gone by 50-55% but its still there, with  normal usage its temperature is 40-42degree, so overheating i am hopeful that it will improve with the upcoming updates, i also noticed from 10% to 100% charging is done but if my ear keeps getting burned in the calls then i will definitely return it, i will give it a chance for 2 more days for that, if any update i will do it in my review.to sum up the above review,ProsStock android with quick updatesGreat performance, best for the price. (no effect of over heating)Superb battery with turbo charger ( can last whole day with normal usage and 6hours with heavy usgae again no effect of over heating)awesome fingerprintnice cameraseparate memory card slotConsO V E R H E A T I N GHeats like a hellits not water resistantother cons like no nfc, no magnetic sensor, compass etc dont matter for me, design could have been better although it can be accepted for all other great features, overall for me only above two cons, out of which overheating mainly hence one star less.and as i said will return it if it continue to give my ear burning sensation while talking on calls, will check it for 2 days more.UPDATE -  overheating issue is almost gone (70-80%), it overheats now only while charging and with heavy usage like most of other phones, and the problem i mentioned above, pains my ear on calls only if i talk for 1 hour or so, no major issue now, i presume the update which was received by the phone worked big time.overall  i am happy now with the phone, thumbs up from my side. all looking to buy this phone shouldn't worry about overheating issue, the update will fix it. cheers.UPDATE 2 - After few days of use its turbo charger is not working as great, now it takes more than 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 15%"

5.0 , 29 May 2016,"Really excellent mobile, worth for the money. I liked the keypad touch sensitivity , it's really fast and cool. The finger print sensor as well works very well and till now not seen any miss in detection.The download speed over wifi is really good, the RAM available to user is around 2GB apart from its 3GB.  In ROM out of 32 GB the Android OS takes 6.62gb remaining space is provided to user.Overall I would say it's worth for the money that is put on the brand with the trust as a customer , appreciate Amazon team for delivering the same on the first day itself"

5.0 , 30 May 2016,"Got this for my father. However, I've had a complete week to test this device out. For me, that's really good enough!What I love about this device:1. I usually don't prefer phones beyond 5". Currently I'm using a Nexus 5 (original). I felt that was the perfect size for me. But surprisingly, moto G4 does feel good. It's light and not too big. For those who are hesitating to get this because of size, please go ahead and try this phone. ( I still prefer 5" screens though)2. Beautiful display! A big improvement compared to G3.3. I can't go back to bloated OS after using Nexus, so moto is as close to stock as possible. No complaints here.4. Camera is really good, but for outdoor photography only. Sometimes the focus is hit or miss. Professional mode is a big plus. Slow mo is just fine for not-so-serious, casual captures.5. If you've been a Nexus user, you'll definitely crave for that smoothness, and this phone satisfies your craving for that buttery feeling. An occasional stutter, probably cause of the processor, but nothing that you'll notice.6. Did try out a game to see how it holds up. Tried Asphalt8. No complaints :) Quite a sweet experience. Though I'm not a heavy gamer, nor does my father game. So just played to test it out.7. The fingerprint scanner is really good. Kinda makes you addicted to the way you unlock your phone using it. Super fast as well.I felt it would be a good idea to keep it at the back on the moto logo. But it was surprising that the thumb naturally moves to the scanner at the bottom screen. Felt this is in fact a much comfortable location for the scanner than at the back.This is something you'll feel only when you use it. Perfect in my opinion.8. Battery backup depends a lot on users configuration. So I'm not gonna comment on this. Though, It was totally good enough for the way I use.9. I really don't understand what's this "heating-issue" that ppl who review are talking about. May be I'm used to a smartphone's temperature. I barely felt anything close to the heat levels explained by few. It's grossly exaggerated. Only while gaming and long duration of photography the device got hot, which is obviously expected and completely normal.Otherwise it's just warm during normal long continuous usage.Oh, btw, no point screaming "it's hot, it's hot" while you turbocharge the phone.I really felt disappointed with the camera in low light. I even thought something was wrong with the camera until I took it out and captured in bright light.Do keep in mind that we are paying about ₹15k, so keep your camera expectations limited to that range.There's no point rambling about the phone by comparing it to ₹60k worth device in any and every aspectAnother thing I miss is the magnetometer. It does help while you are clueless as to which direction you are pointing while using the maps. Nothing big, but when you get used to it, it does seem to be quite helpful.Overall, I would definitely suggest anyone looking out for great device in this price range, to go for moto g4. I love the phone!"
5.0 , 7 June 2016,"There phone is better than other phones in its class. Works great and gets me through the day. Sounds quality is good. Screen readability sunlight is great. The only issue I had is that, that it gets heated up soon.And not an important feature for all, but I miss moto voice and the phone water resistance ability. Well if it wasn't there before it wouldn't have been mentioned."

5.0 , 23 May 2016,"Superb..!!Great value for money..When you going to hold it then you can feel the quality..It is made of plastic but it is really feels very stronghold..I'm fully satisfied with the design ..@ Screen - The screen is full HD as mentioned and it's a great experience to see videos..great color saturation..Touch and feel of screen is also superb..gorilla glass makes screen robust and smooth to touch@Performanace - It's a stock Android so there is no lag overall ..I played modern combat 5 over it..and it's played wonderfully even mine is 2 GB RAM model.@ Battery - Battery backup is very good believe me I charge it 100% in morning with fast charger in 1hour and now this is next day morning I'm writing this review and still it is 27% great..what else you want (with moderate - hard usage)..Motorola really paid their debt about battery..@ camera - Stunning ..both front and rear camera works great..U never feels that u bought a 13000k phone it is give the quality like above 20000k..The color production and overall quality is very good..not found any bad point..@ other features - finger print scanner is works fast and it's very responsive.. I compared it with xiome note 3 and moto wins.. People saying it is on weird position but I played with xiome's back sided and I found one thing that whenever u going to unlock it u need to hold it proper way to apply ur index finger and again to operate screen u have to hold it other position and with bigger screen it is always not easy..I dropped xiome once..so I'm satisfied with moto's concept..greatThe overall feel of the mobile is great you can definitely go for it and for me it is best than xiome..we are the people who don't wants to ruined our phone by playing games on it..and for regular usage it is beast..I only doubted about battery due to its light weight but in that section also I found it superb..so don't think go for it..!!"
4.0 , 23 May 2016,"Phone is good but it came late ...Some things that i dont like1) when u open and check for updates a 150 MB update appears and u have to do this because no apps will not get downloaded unless you do this. installation took 30 minutes as claimed by the company... update download time extra.4) apps were not getting downloaded even after update. i have to do a factory reset. &lt;- VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT3) preloded wallpapers are not too good.4) the data gets on automatically.5) gets heated very fast. just downloaded some apps like whatsapp , fb , messenger , snapchat , insta and this phone got heated.7) earphones looks are very bad but their sound quality is awesome.8) the box of phone looks very dull. phone was just kept without inserting it in a protection , something like polythene cover.9) there comes no USB cable , with this phone.10) while the apps were getting downloaded, i saw lag while scrolling down whatsapp contacts.NOW GOOD POINTS1) Camera quality is very very very good , they have got benchmark of 84 (this is the rating that phone industry gives) camera. the rating is greater than iphone 6 plus . and guys trust me, thats the best camera i have ever seen. i have samsung note4 and iphone 6 , but this phone is awesome when thinking of camera. camera opens quickly. The photos i have attached are taking in very very dull light. but the camera features makes pic visible. i have taking this area's photograph because it is surrounded by buildings.2) Moto features are very good. it feels like u r magician , just give some twist and turns , camera will open . just keep phone's screen down and phone will be silent and many more.3) gaming experience is very good.4) sound quality of phone is very good. while receiving calls , i was able to experience this.5) fingerprint. this feature is just awesome. response time is very less.6) design is pretty good. i have cancelled the back cover order. phone is slim and it feels good while holding this phone.7) touch is extremely good.i suggest you to buy this phone, if u love photography and is fond of having a fast android experience ."

3.0 , 13 June 2016,"My Honest review after using it for a WEEKJust another average Smartphone.Turbo Charger:- The Much hyped turbo charger doesn't work as it was expected. It takes at least 2.5 hrs to completely charge the battery.Earphones:- Not of premium quality. Same as the previous earphones.Heating:-  Yes , it also heats up a lot . Even in low temperatures it heats up . In my case the phone gets heated after 2 or 3 alarm clock notification. At the time of charging the phone gets heated .Battery Back-up :- If u use internet them at max it will last for 12-13 hrs. So battery back-up also average .Design :-  Yes , the design and look of the phone is nice. It looks like a costly handset.Camera :- Not much better than other smartphones in this range . the camera is normal one.You may get a lot of features in the phone but for  normal users it is overpriced . I think Lenevo Zuk better than this one .And most important thing is that this smartphone is manufactured by Lenevo because , it displays lenevo on Switching on .In nutshell the phone is overpriced and hyped . It's price should have been around 12000 for 32gb"
4.0 , 13 June 2016,"It was a very reluctant purchase for a iPhone 5s user. In few hours the reluctance gave way to satisfaction and later it turned into happiness and pleasant surprise.I am pretty impressed with this device and would strongly recommend. I will try not to delve into what so many others have talked about, and jot down only key points.Pros:&gt; Hand gestures for switching on/off flashlight and camera. Very impressive and handy. No need to touch the side buttons and just shake (or turn) phone to switch on/off flashlight (or camera)&gt; Summary of notifications as soon as the phone is moved from the idle position. Again, no need to touch the side buttons to get a glimpse of any emails/messages etc.&gt; Finger print sensor unlocks the phone instantly. Much better when compared to iPhone 5s.&gt; Excellent display clarity.Cons:&gt; I miss the Time Lapse feature in iPhone.&gt; Feels less durable in hand. Plastic feeling. (P.S. I was a iPhone user)&gt; Cheap/Poor ear phone in Box.&gt; No USB cable in Box. Charger does not have the USB cable hence cannot be plugged into your computer.&gt; Charger is bulky. (May be because of turbo charging)&gt; Can't remove the Google Search bar from the Home page."
4.0 , 13 June 2016,"Got it with in 3 days...1. When i compare it with my old redmi 1s, UI is better in redmi, as always MI brought us the best UI i had experienced.2. Next minority with G4 is that, it's fingerprint sensor serms to be a home button but didnt do anything else other than unlocking that is toooo bad.3. Batter backup - i am a hardcore gamer, usualy 6-7 hrs of gameing per day still i need yo charge it only at morning and will be fully charged within 85 mins..4. Camera - camera is awsome on day light, but in low light it seems to be so sad... image size is likely above 4MB so i guess my google backup will need more storage.Front cam is not as much as perfect as expected but rearcam will overcome that expectation.Advantage is that its light weight and too slim, so if you are careless you would be buying another one soon...3GB ram is awsome i can play clash of clans, same time could keep up with my whatsapp chat, when went back to game, no loadings.. no lags as smooth as possible.Around 24 GB is available now, thus i dnt need a external storage..."

I tested this phone for arround 12hrs of continuous use.Phone gets heated after uses of 15min camera and heavy games. But loved that it do not lag after the heat.Phone funtions is getting updated by Moto day by day, i got number of upadate inculing Contact, camera tuner,  OS, Android system web veiw.So i am sure heating issue will soon rectify by moto in future updates.Verdict..Oveall in this budget, with Stock Android version which gets Android updates OS or software updated first in the market, i can say this is an awesome phone."
5.0 , 12 June 2016,"I ordered this mobile in the first day launch. I was waiting eagerly to buy mobile. With all these Chinese companies coming up with 3gb ram and finger print sensor in the 12-15k range, it was tough to make a decision. But as soon as Moto G4 plus announced their release I decided to buy without any further thoughts. Thats the quality they provide. Without any doubts the mobile is much better than its competitors in the same range. Good performance , good battery, better speed, better camera, Moto always surprises you. Faced little trouble with Amazon in delivering the product, could understand due to the demand. But initially the waiting period made me to panic. Thanks to the wonderful customer support who kept me posted on my package's status. There were so many offers with the launching period, being a fan of Superstar, I was quite eager for the audio launch. But no further details from Amazon. So I guess we r far behind getting some prizes. Happy with the mobile, Valuable for your money, quality of mobile headphones coming with in the box could be improved."
3.0 , 10 June 2016,"Just got my replacement phone today. 1st phone was replaced as it lagged even during simple games like those from King Software like Bubble Witch Saga.  And that too with only 3-4 apps running. Another problem is that I am getting  duplicate icons in the apps drawer which I have seen for the first time in any phone. Yet to test the replacement piece for performance though the duplicate icon issue persists in this one too. Another friend also has sent his piece for replacement due to performance issues.Negatives apart, there are some excellent positives.Camera is fabulous and laser focus is spot on and really fast. Fingerprint  sensor is pretty fast and accurate too. Phone performs pretty fast except those instances when it lags.Phone feels good to hold, not too big even with the 5.5 inch display. Near stock Android experience minus the bloatware is great too .I suggest you also look at alternatives in similar price range with more coming in.One thing you need to keep in mind is that starting 11th May you cannot return mobile phones and a lot of other electronic items like computers and laptops etc as per new Amazon returns policy. You can only get a replacement of the same device. So be very sure on what you order."
5.0 , 8 June 2016,"Pretty good phone, ordered it on the 18th, got it in like 3 days or something. Haven't experienced any major problem yet. And as for the heating "problem", it only heats up when turbo charger is connected (which is fine). Only think I've noticed is the time on the fingerprint scanner is increasing as I use the phone. The only huge disappointment to me was Moto ditching the Gallery app for this device, Photos sucks, really. Otherwise the phone is a pretty solid buy. Great product from Moto.-Good enough camera with Pro Mode-Turbo charger is actually helpful-Already dropped it once no visible scratches or cracks.-Quite lightInbuilt File Manager (yay!)This is actually worth your money.gr8 product i r8 8/8EDIT: Saw some other reviews about the phone heating up as soon as it's connected to the Wi-Fi or playing a game or something. It doesn't. Watched a show for a few hours straight, no heating at all. Doesn't heat up when connected to Wi-Fi or while taking calls. As mentioned earlier only time it heats up is when the turbo charger is connected, which is fine."
5.0 , 6 June 2016,"This is after using the mobile for more than 10 days..First of all Amazon service is top notch.. Coming to the mobile it is not a great looking phone but it is not bad in looks either. More than looks a mobile need to serve its purpose and Moto G4 plus does that.The best feature in this mobile is its Camera.. Some of the photos taken are just mind boggling, over excessive usage of Camera the mobile tends to heat up a bit, not alarming one but still strange. Front cam too takes good pictures.Stock Android performs the way it is expected to perform, Advantage of stock android is mobile is expected to get all google latest updates once they release. Call clarity and quality is perfect. I have not received any complaint yet from opposite partyTurbo Charger charges the mobile from 15% to 99% in an hr and 15 mins. Mobile heats while charging, I am not a person who uses mobile while charging so not a issue for me. Battery life for me comes for more than one and a half day. I wont play games and I just browse net and watch video at timesFinger print scanner is best in the business. I have not even had one failed attempt yet. Performs just like any top end mobileSound clarity is okayish I can hear sound on receiving calls and headphone music quality is good. I didn't try with Moto headsets as I am not a fan of that kind of headsets.I wish it had LED notification as I need to check the mobile often for any notifications.On the whole Moto has come up with a Gem of product. Instead of putting too much money on decorating the mobile they have come up with a good mobile which can perform too.."
4.0 , 6 June 2016,"Got the 3GB RAM version from Amazon a couple of days back. The packaging was not up to the mark, a simple box with no bubble wrap or protection for the phone box inside whatsoever. Disappointed a little with the packagaing but got my phone without without any scratches, so I m happy.As for the phone, I am still playing around but my first impressions have been highly positive. Its is smooth, comes with stock android marshmallow which I love and the best part, is the display.I love how the 5.5-inch 1080p IPS LCD looks, its warm, bright and pleasant for reading and watching. The whites tones comes out good and the other colors are pretty good as well. Under the sun, I just had to bump up the brightness to 50% and everything was visible perfectly well.Processor is smooth and in case you are wondering, theres heating. I mean, the phone gets hot while using the camera app or playing games for around half n hour. But it isnt a deal breaker and till now, the phone hasnt heated to an extent that it affects usability. The plastic textured back does help to limit the heat felt on your hand. If it was metal, I guess the heat would have become an issue. But till now, heating hasnt been a big problem. You just feel it sometimes when using your phone. So, definitely not a deal breaker.As for the camera, I have heard its the best in the segment. Havent really tested out in a lot of places, but my first impression has been good. It focuses very quickly thanks to laser focus n the images r sharp and bright. The UI is pretty decent as well. You will be able to capture great pictures under good lighting conditions. Night time pictures arent that impressive, but its decent. For 15k definitely a great camera.Battery is decent, at par withother 3000mah phones, but whats really the highlight is the turbo charge which quickly fills up the juice.Call clarity is decent and the reception is good as well. No problems in this department.The UI is smooth n Motorola was smart to limit their bloatware. So the UI is clean, responsive and stock.I guess, that sums up most of the features of the phone.For 15K look no further than the Moto G4 Plus."
5.0 , 6 June 2016,"As of now i have been using this as my primary device for 3 days now.I am not a heavy gamer, just basic games.Review:The build of the phone is great.Camera is awesome.Battery backup is decent if not exceptional, got a SoT of 6 hours.UI is damn smooth, courtesy almost stock android.Fingerprint sensor is the best i have ever used, quick and accurate.Sound from the speakers was nice and crisp, it did not crack up at the full volume either.Call quality and cellular reception is nice as well.Display quality is just amazing.And features like 'ok google' works like butter and bread maybe because of almost stock android. It is very good.Even the heating issue that has been so hyped was not present.Phone did heat up and that too just during the charging, which is pretty normal considering the quick charge support.Apart from it the phone did not heat up abnormally. So, i'd rate it 9.5/10 for the features and performance this device provides in this price segment.Go for it, buy it and enjoy.Hope this review helps many potential buyers."
5.0 , 2 June 2016,"Reached within 4 days of order placement!By the specifications of the phone one could imagine the performance of the phone.In terms of form factor it is almost close to a phablet but still one can hold it in one hand. reaching to the top of the phone can be a little difficult with one hand.Back cover is easily removable to put 2 micro sims &amp; memory card. Battery is not removable though.All is plastic except the metal surround on the edges, still the phone feels solid.It has a notification LED at the bottom right side(besides finger print scanner) but only glows once when charger is plugged in.It doesn't glow for notifications (yet).Finger print scanner is super fast and works in any orientation.Multiple fingers can be registered for recognition.Display is sharp but tint is warmer(yellow-ish).The cable coming through fast charger is not detachable from it, to do data transfer.Headphones are average. Not in-ear ones.Loudspeaker is loud enough.Volume &amp; lock/unlock buttons are easy to press.Overall a great phone for this price."
4.0 , 1 June 2016,"Hello All,I'm submitting this review for all who is looking for a new good mobile in terms of performance and look &amp; feel and having rich features.Yes, i'm talking about Moto G4 Plus. Last week i was sailing in the same boat where i got totally confused which mobile should i buy based on the different customer feedback on diff. websites. After all analysis, i landed up my search on Moto G4 and got the device in hand on 31-May-16.Submitting this review based on experience so far till then. It's really a nice device because:1. It's very light weight and easy to handle although it's 5.5 inch.2. Fingerprint scanner works awesome3. Internet works comparatively fast (compare to previous device)4. Both Cameras' picture qualities are really good5. I hardly feel device heating issue while charging and talking, it's very low (May be because of processor, i'm not technical expert )6. Special features like: shake device twice to turn on torch, in similar fashion camera alsoCons, these can be ignored:1. Turbo Charger don't have led light2. Earphone quality can be improvedPlease ignore negative feedback about this mobile or spend more bucks to get the same configuration from other brands."
5.0 , 29 May 2016,"Bought this phone on 26th May 6:00 PM IST and opted for one day delivery. Product got delivered to me at around 3:30 next day so kudos to delivery guys, I will be very precise and review this product as per the doubts and confusion i had while purchasing this product.First thing - Looks and ImpressionThis phone looks absolutely adorable . Its sleek and light in weight . Black is the color you should go for as it gives you a piece of glass feeling when lying idle on the table top .Believe me black is better as one of my friend bought white and we have compared both and black looks more premium . But ultimately is your own choice and liking mattersFinger printWorks magic 9 out of 10  times few misses here and there that's all.CameraSelling point of this phone is its Camera . Best in class , superb quality and unmatchable bouquet effectBattery and Power ChargingPhone charges in about 2 hours and 26 minutes to be exact from Zero to 100 % . Which is not that fast but when yo compare it with likes of MI and One Plus its better. Battery is 3000 mAh which is sufficient for your one day(not nights) extensive use . By extensive use i mean playing 30 - 40 mins of heavy games , 30 -40 mins of streaming songs / videos online , usual calls and continuous use of 4g .Battery back up could have been better but nevertheless you get power to charge your phone real quick and believe me15 mins of charge is enough to keep your phone awake for another six hours if you cut down data , wifi and gamings and use your phone just to make calls.HeatingYes phone gets warm but cools down quickly as well. If you use ur phone while charging yet it gets heated then. Also i have noticed phone getting warm while playing games and using camera for long period of time and its just warm not hot.DisplayIts another USP of this phone . As soon as you power on this device for the first time you will get goose bumps.Display is bright and crisp. viewing angles are great. Nothing more to improve in this department. I don't feel this device overpriced. Rather i would say its value for your money. If you want to buy this just go for it and you wouldn't regret."
3.0 , 29 May 2016,"Not definitely a deal breaker but decent phone and a Moto brand trust.PROS-Great camera for still picturesDisplay improved than previous Moto gFlawless gaming smooth performanceBetter and wider front cameraFinger print scanner working very fast and efficientlyGreat focusing thanks to laser auto focusNo lagginess smooth performanceTurbo charger supplied in the box(1%/min)CONS-Heating issues. 1- using camera for 15mins heats- 2/5 2- gaming for 30mins- 3/5 3- watching movies- 2/5 4- navigation/maps- 3/5Yellowish tinted displayNo compass sensor(for frequent and accurate use of navigation)Flash panel is raised above camera hubFinger print scanner isn't a capacitive buttons (should have been more functional)Average speakerSnapdragon 617 bit a heater (650 would have been better)Average battery- for heavy users, say gaming, navigation, 4g users battery can be a disappointment. But of average and normal usage battery can last for one full day.Back panel not that handy- average grip, no curved backAverage audio output- not recommended for music lovers( Moto failed to get this phone a good sound engine)No IR sensor- all the rivals has IR sensors in this range.Bigger bezels- for a phone of this size the bezels should have been narrowed special at the top. For a average user I would recommend this phone. Does the job, light weight, nice camera(better than zukZ1 and note3), elegant design, Moto brand trust, smooth gaming, average battery. Not recommended for those looking for extreme battery backup with heavy gaming, movies, navigation and those looking for good audio output through headphone jack."
5.0 , 28 May 2016,"Cons:1. 5.5" will take some time to get used to.2. No LED notification. Deal with it.3. Overheats 'a bit' while gaming for extended times. (A bit part has to be underlined)4. Charger isn't modular. USB cable has to be bought separately.5. No compass sensor. Slight delay during sharp turns using Maps.6. Hard plastic, not metal as nearest competitors provide.7. 3000 mAh battery seems less.Pros:1. Beautiful design language. Very slim. Pretty to look at.2. Screen quality is too good. 1080p comes in handy. Also, gone are the yellowish tints of earlier Moto screens.3. SD 617Chipset + Adreno 405 GPU + 3 GB RAM + Near Stock Android equates to snippy performance. No lags whatsoever.4. Gaming is smooth as any. Day to day operations breeze through.5. Camera is top notch. I extensively use my phone's camera, so take my word for it. IT IS PRETTY GOOD. It is actually the highlight of the device.6. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and comparable even to iPhones 6S's fingerprint sensor.7. Battery gets you through the day. Better than my Xiaomi Mi4i's performance.8. 32 GB is more than enough capacity. I've put another 64 GB Sandisk UHS XC Card. You can expand it up to 128 GB though.9. Audio output through the headphone jack is not stellar, but can't complain. It is GOOD!10. Overall, a pretty good and sturdy package."
5.0 , 27 May 2016,"Excellent delivery timeline by Amazon. Delivered Within 60 hours of placing the order The Moto G4 displays excellent research and development put in by the Motorola and Lenovo teams. Right from the moment it is unboxed, this phone doesnt fail to capture your attention. Excellent finish and design. The 16MP Laser Autofocus shooter is brilliant in an outdoor and a lit environment. Sharp, bright and high definition images is the outcome. 3GB Ram alongwith the 617 Snapdragon delivers a smooth and lag-free performance. What I love the most about this phone is the Stock OS. Android, the way it is made. If you master the use and functions of the OS, you're no doubt in possession of a true smart phone. The detailed customization of every feature of your phone is possible due to this. Loved the Turbo Charging feature given with this one. 9% to 80% within 45 minutes. Headphones supplied alongwith are very mediocore especially if you are used to in-ear phones. An extremely efficient and powerful phone for the price paid. The fingerprint sensor is fast, responsive  and accurate. The speciality of the G4 is the combination of great tech and build alongwith pure Android. People who are comparing this one with other phones, please remember that other companies dont offer Stock Android and you have to deal with loads of bloatware and pre installed crap.The 3000 mAh battery gives me an average of 20-22 hours with heavy/moderate usage."
5.0 , 25 May 2016,"I ordered the 32gb variant at midnight, the moment it released and have been using it for quite a while now. All I can say is that this is the best phone at this price! It comes with marshmallow 6.0.1 out of the box and the company has promised upgrades to android N and O. Every feature has its own advantages and disadvantages. Few I've explained below...1) There is hardly any bloat ware. Google apps are inbuilt, but barring those you can hardly find any more apps. This is good as you gain more internal memory and can add apps as you desire. But people not familiar with applications might find this a bit disappointing.2) The camera seems to be the most talked feature about this phone. 16mp laser focus works pretty good in the day time but not as expected in low light conditions.3) 3000mah battery that comes with this phone is pretty good. But due to the large display, a fair amount of usage will discharge a fully charged phone by evening.4) The turbo charging feature seems good but is not that impressive. It takes around 2 hours for a complete charge and does heat up the phone even though it is faster as compared to normal chargers.5) Talking about ram, I have no complaints. Out of the 3gb, ram usage hardly reaches 2gb even during gaming. Thus there's no lag whatsoever.6) Talking about the fingerprint sensor, the unlocking is very fast as promised by Motorola (or should I say Lenovo now). I have seen many people complaining about mistaking it for a home button. But trust me, it has not once disappointed me. And even if you do, you'll soon get used to it.7) And lastly I will talk about the hearing problem. Well, I don't think this is an issue. Even with WiFi on the whole day, my phone doesn't hear up. Only on heavy downloads or during charging, you might find the phone warming up a little but it doesn't become too hot.In this price range, I feel this is the best phone you can get. The screen colors look vibrant and. the body looks good too. If you ask me, I would definitely say go for it! And if you are a heavy user, I would certainly recommend the 32gb variant."
4.0 , 13 June 2016,"I have been using this phone since May 22nd n I have liked the phone.Its has a lacklusture processor but the phone makes it up with the awesome camera and decent looks.I had ghost touch issue while charging the phone but it seems the fault with the turbo charger. ( No, I did not opt for replacement)There are heating issues but it is not a deal breaker as I personally use my cell for social networking, browsing and taking snaps n have not found any instances where the phone gets severely heated.The finger print scanner works like a charm !!!Heavy gamers would not like the phone as the processor is just not good enough.The battery backup is decent n lasts for the complete day with normal to slightly heavy usage.The turbo chargers comes in handy n the battery juices up in 90 mins.So the bottom line is at 15k you r getting a decent deal. If are smart enough to not compare the phone with other flagships, I think you will love the phone."
4.0 , 11 June 2016,"The motorola phones are way different from all Chinese brands . You will get instant updates of Android and software.  Now coming to phoneSimply if you got rid of reading long reviews , I'll recommend you to buy this phone in one click without having second option in your brain .it's totally worth it.Detailed review :-1) The UI and screen quality is damn awesome gives you a full premium looks in hand .2) camera this time nailed every phone in this segment.  Somewhat pixelate images in indoor but that too with every phone and in comparison with other its far better. Professional mode is stupendous I must say.3) Battery backup is also quite decent and of course turbo charging a saviour to a phone.4) Finger print sensor is really accurate and precise just takes a second to unlock .5) plenty of storage and moreover expansion is possible6) overall performance is nice go for it and I'm not facing extensive heating problem , a luck for me ."

5.0 , 31 May 2016,"Purchased on 26.After a lot of search I choose this phone.Camera is superb.immediately got an system update. battery back up of 12 hrs with moderate usage on 4g.No any such heating issue.. when you first time install all apps and charge simultaneously may expect little overheating otherwise no any issues.1.5 GB RAM always available. system takes 6 GB. so u get 25 GB finally. finger print sensor works with 100 % efficiency .overall thumbs up...u ll never regret ur decision!!!☺"

5.0 , 9 June 2016,"I had bought my new moto g4. The first impression from the phone is its slim bodyand about its performance- I had played NOVA 3 Asphalt8 Godfire and Gangstar vegas which runned very smoothlyafter half an hour of gameplay the phone gets slightly heated which is somewhat badlokking for Cam it is very goodIam rating it 8/10 for Ur budget"

5.0 , 30 May 2016,"Completely satisfied with the product (Have been using for one week till date).  Everything is as promised.  Was worried a little regarding the heating issue mentioned by many buyers.  However, I felt that the device is not heating all the time (only while charging and heavy net usage) and the temperature is not troublesome as such."
4.0 , 5 June 2016,"I'm a fan of Moto display and with G4, the display quality is really good even in bright sunlight also. I was using oneplus 2 but stopped using it now because of G4 ease of use and turbo charging feature. Though NFC is missing but never used it so far on the other sets I had. Unless you have NFC compatible gadgets at home, NFC is of no use and especially in India as of now. Performance is really smooth, no issues so far. Looks are clean and does look premium at the price. With turbo charging feature I'm not worried about battery, however battery lasts your working day easily with normal usage. Fingerprint is blazing fast because of almost vanilla Android. Only feature I miss compared to one plus is the home button integration with fingerprint and double tap to switch off display. Camera is good and not great because OIS is missing. Else steady images are really good quality even in artificial light. Speaker is loud enough and cellular call quality is also good."

5.0 , 15 June 2016,"If this is your first smartphone you will never leave it. Things may change if it's not your firstFirst thing first I am not going to describe it's specifications as you already know it. Earphone is not good so if you love music you have to change it but overall call quality and speaker is excellent camera is best in class many compare it to iphone 6 and it's true but heats up after using more than 30 min but in reality who uses more than 30 min. People are complaining for heating issues there are some heating issues on only hardcore big games but it cools really fast..overall heating issue is a con but it's OK as not everything can be awesome..pure Android stock and instant upgrade makes it best plus moto brand reliability. What else can you ask for in 150000.Screen is good with HD quality and colours look great. Several amazing features which I can't describe here are also there. It's a quite good mobile but simply can't keep the market in moto's hand"
3.0 , 15 June 2016,"Not worth for Rs.15000, better than this lenovo Zuk z1 is very good. i have bought this phone for my friend and i am using zuk z1"
5.0 , 16 June 2016,"I will rate MOTO G PLUS the best as its price worthy for the options provided and indeed an stock android!Phone is great with splendid crystal clear display, turbo charging option, totally feather light, touchscreen is very fast &amp; sensitive, finger print screen lock option is amazing! The phone is at par for the price offered with above features.I didn't encounter heating issues when phone was put to heavy use. Initial stages found the phone slightly heating during system updates and for some app functions but after 2 weeks usage &amp; system updated this got rectified.Drawback is that phone gets over heated during turbo charging. Turbo charge facilitates charging of battery to 100% in an hour which is pretty fast and might be the cause for over heating. I presume in next software updates this might get rectified.  Also another pain point is that charger is not equipped with detachable USB cable.Overall very good gadget!!!"
5.0 , 29 May 2016,"Apart from all the common features like the  snapdragon processor,the RAM, the internal memory,the feature to merge your flash memory as internal memory; the best thing about Moto is it gives you Android updates as on when it's released, by promising Android N, at a price rate that's around 14k, it just deserves a 5 star.The laser focused camera and the fingerprint button are the best thing in this. Though the fingerprint button doesn't act as a home button, it still will start to grow on you as it helps in popping up the bar when you're on any screen."

1.0 , 28 May 2016,"The packaging was very poor, no bubble wrap, the phone even had a small dent on the corner as the box was smashed at the corner. But still I wanted to keep the phone but then it started to heat up like crazy while charging, like really really hot. You can make an omelette on that. Don't know what to do. It's been 4 days only. I want a replacement.PS: I saw another man using this phone and asked if he was facing the same problem. I found out that the glass of the phone is not supposed to be curved like my phone. Was this because of the poor packaging? So far, it has been a "wonderful" experience. Amazon, if you are seeing this, make it right."

If I'm in AC environment, the phone works  fine, I get almost 5:30 hrs of SOT. But if you go out it starts to heat up from the back, battery drains faster, even if you use it for  browsing, and I'm talking phone getting more than warm in my case which is very unusual, this also reduces SOT which sometimes gets me only 2:30 hrsAlso, playing games will not give any good experience, the phone suffers extreme heat(I've experienced this in Angry Birds2), 15min of gaming, n i was unable to hold my phone.The good thing is its ram management turbo charger which works as mentioned( but I still think 15 min won't give u 6hrs, marketing gimmick) and camera which is superb in every way possibleAlso the stock experience is really nice"

4.0 , 9 June 2016,"got my moto g4 plus today on 9th june, and after using for 6 hours, this is my initial impression of this phonemy handset is not heating, i mean, the way reviews about heating of this device i have seen, my device is cool, even when charging and installing apps at the same time, and playing low graphic games, did not face any issuePros: very fast and accurate fingerprint sensor, crisp full HD 5.5 inch display, front facing speaker is good (not so loud, but good), very nice and fast camera, stock android (hoping for android N soon), black color looks decent (doesn't look cheap at all, if not expensive)Cons: no USB cable (i have from my oneplus x, so had no problem with it), cheap earphone in the box (again, i have ear pods from iphone 6, no issues), i wish it was water resistant, battery only 3000mah (phone is big, so i guess it could fit 3600mah)thats it for the initial impressions, you should not think twice, just buy it, its pure android experienceREVIEW after 2 days of use:charging the phone and playing mortal combat 5 at the same time, i don't find my g4 heating at all, i don't know why.. i am happy.am using zooper widget pro and nova launcher prime, all working well, no lag, no heating as of now, airtel 4G on this phone is superb, battery is also fine, not very good, but acceptable for the kind of usage, i love the finger print reader, its super fast, and people are complaining about finger print sensor positioning, i guess, it is the only place where it should be.its the best device in this range, i have used oneplus x, which is also a nice phone, but i was missing finger print sensor..go for it, looking forward to moto z now!"
5.0 , 9 June 2016,"I have heard a lot about 'problems' in the device. But let's be honest, I personally have no exceptionally high expectation from a device costing 14.5 K from a reputed brand (Sorry, I do not consider Mi, Coolpad or LeTV as reputed brands).The phone is quite snappy - thanks to the near stock Android - came with May Security Patch pre installed, so cudos to Lenovo for that!Camera is pretty good, much better than my OGP (E988). Professional mode is a very welcome addition, but I don't how much I / anyone will use it. As you can see - in the auto mode dusk photos are not as awesome... too much smoothening is happeningSound quality through headphone is pretty loud and clear. Through speaker phone, well....FM Radio has recording facility as well as using a handsfree is not mandatory.The phone battery backup is quite Good (but keep in mind I am only using it for the last 4 or 5 days). I am using single SIM (AirTel 4G) with either 4G/ 3G or Wifi on (Depending on what is available) and lasts easily for a day."
5.0 , 2 June 2016,"Before I mention anything about the phone,let me address the infamous HEATING ISSUE :-The phone heats up a bit in case you play games all day, use camera all the time, construct a rocket or contact aliens. But it doesn't reach up to such a temperature that you can cook or boil tea or something like that, nope.Just warms up a bit.Now, about the phone/performance :-- The camera is EXCELLENT. It's amazing. The pictures and videos come out bright and detailed.- The fingerprint scanner is really good. Quick response. Really quick.- It does not lag... at all. Almost. Really, I never experienced any kind of lagging, freezing, or anything like that while switching between apps, games (or even playing heavy games like Gangstar Vegas).- The screen is warm, smooth and cozy like mummy's home-made food.- Turbo-charging is love, Turbo-charging is life. Phone charges faster than an Indian kid deciding to take up Engineering.- Stock Android experience is lovely.Now, about the Design:To actually explain the design of this phone in one word, it is WEIRD.But I like weird, because this review too falls in that category.Anyway,- The fingerprint scanner is NOT the home-button. Someone spread this via social-media so people can understand.- The headphone jack is not really smooth, but in a way keeps the earphones/headphones strongly attached.- The best part I liked about the overall build of this phone is the fact that even though it has a big screen, the phone fits in my hand like a charm, ready to be loved.Piece of advice for heavy-users -----&gt; if you are bothered by the 'heat', get a rubber/matte-finish back cover."

Well the experience part-As it was 'rumoured' , phone did NOT get heated up while charging or even after 3-4hrs continuos usage. Front camera awesome...back camera is more like a DSLR, with all the professional features. Battery life is a class!! The smoothness is class!! And fingerprint sensor!! Oh My God!!You can unlock your phone from almost any angle by just placing your finger on the sensor. It scans in not even a second. Colors are vividly displayed on its 5.5 inch screen which also holds the speaker.Looks a little like Samsung Note3 but a whole new level of technology when operated. With such a high RAM, it feels like my data connection has crossed 49kbps;) I bought the 32gb model but feel that 16gb would be sufficient for the general purposes.looks great in black colour... Even if you remove the back panel, the view is a visual treat!!P.S.- Though in the15k range, moto g4+ is a deadly  competition for all those 'flag ship killers' coming from the upper segment."
4.0 , 31 May 2016,"I have been using this phone for around one week. Here is a review for people like me who are looking for a phone for normal usage and are not that much into the technical aspects.Pros1.The phone is light. The looks are quite awesome. The back cover is made of plastic and has good design on it and looks pretty good too.2.The display on the screen is quite good and crisp.3. The phone  boasts about the camera and Frankly it hasn't disappointed the users. The picture quality is awesome and there are lot of features too like slow motion video , professional mode ,etc.4. The battery gets charged pretty quick ( full charge in 100 Min).Thanks to the new technology of turbo Charging .5. The phone is quite fast too with 3GB ram .6. U have 32 GB storage and extendable upto 128GB too. For for normal use 32 GB is more than enough.7. The fingerprint scanner is quite fancy. Unlocking the phone was never so easy and fast !8. The hand gestures in the phone are Awesome too!Cons1. Moto doesnt have its own dedicated Gallery and Music apps for the phone. You will have to use the Google Music and Google Photos for this purpose which isnt that great to handle and also you can't hide photos and all.2. The battery doesn't run as much as it boats of. It lasts around 12 hours for a normal usage. But the turbocharger Feature overcomes this problem.3. There is no inbuilt option to lock the apps, but you can install such apps from play Store.4. The Camera drains a lot of battery. Again the picture quality and turbocharger takes care of this problem and you wont complaint much about it!5. There is no USB cable along with the charger(its a non detachable one). But you get those cables really cheap to buy.6. There is no Led notification light but the phone's motion sensor shows you the lock screen and the notifications as soon as you pick up the phone.7. The phone gets heated up a bit over but it's common problem seen in phones these days and you won't the heat that muh because of the plastic case cover.8. The fingerprint scanner serves its sole purpose and you tend to mistaken it for home button but over time you get used to it.This is definitely a great phone in its segment and proves worth its money."
3.0 , 25 May 2016,"Heating and getting sluggish while running more than one app. Please read till end.Overall good specs but not that great performance, device gets easily heated up and slows down.Why were the g4 and g4 play not for sale on the launch day?Motorola should have introduced g4 in 5 inch and g4 plus in 5.5 the screen size should have been the diffence and not the specs, as not all like a huge phone to carry around.ProsAll great specs in a mobile priced at 14999 that to from a great company.Turbo charging works like a charmGreat display and touchGood looks (would appreciate a smaller device)ConsHeating up very fast with browsing for 5 mins or with games in 3 minsThe phone slows down in a minute while searching images in chromeThe device got sluggish when downloding from play storeThe phone got hang up 3 times in 3 days on medium usage ( heavy usage not yet tried)The battery just gave 12 hrs on lite to medium usageLenovo branding should have been avoided, as very less resell for lenovo in market.Moto g4 plus is another great mobile from Motorola but...could have used a better CPU.Thanks Amazon for their speedy delivery.Would update after 7 days...."
5.0 , 24 May 2016,"Phone is amazing.Camera  is awesome.Turbo charging is really  helpful.Speaker output is excellent.Vivid and bright display.(8/10)Output through headphone is also nice.Fingerprint  sensor  is accurate like 90%.The only con I found out was when connected to turbocharger it heats. The phone does not heat during usage only heats during turbocharging.Switching between apps is fast.The fingerprint sensor should have been used as a home button most of the time the finger automatically goes on the fingerprint sensor.  As most of the mobile that come out now have the home button as the fingerprint sensor but this Moto G 4 + is a unique  model..Coming to the storage department 25 GB of memory is available to the user.4G works efficiently on this mobile.Since Android is a stock Android there is no bugs in it. Battery backup is excellent and will last full day.Amazon packing and delivery was awesome and really fast they delivered the mobile to me on the next day.(Normal delivery was selected).Corning  gorilla glass does its job well though a tempered glass and an armor would  be recommended."
5.0 , 1 June 2016,"I'm using the device from a week and to be honest, device works really smooth.People complain about the heating issues however as per my experience, it only heats up while turbo charging but device gets full charged up in 1-1.5 hours and finger print sensor is really cool :))I'm loving it &lt;3"

4.0 , 29 May 2016,"Hello guys,I bought Moto G4 plus a week ago and Iam very satisfied with the product.The camera is very good and even the low light images are good.The UI of this phone is awesome,The game play is very smooth even for the games like NOVA-3 ASPHALT-8 and FIFA-16, though the mobile heats up a little while playing games but its OK, as every phone heats up a little while playing games. The turbo charging is a bit slow for 1st 20min. but then after that its Really good, mobile tends to  heats up a bit while charging(&amp; that's gonna happen due to the turbo charger).The battery backup is very good. The display is very good &amp; the touch is smooth &amp; awesome.I recommend you to buy this Master piece from Moto (Lenovo) As its price worthy.Hope its Helpful...Thank you for reading my 1st ever review :-)"
4.0 , 6 June 2016,"Everyone has written abt phone. So i would like to mention some drawbacks related to software over hardware. While messaging if you happened to use another sim (dual sim ) you have to go to setting and change the default sim to sim which you want to use for messaging, unlike for calling where there is option for " ask every time". I know its minor issue, but for person like me who has to resort  to messaging for official purpose, it is bit tiring.Putting phone on silent mode is bit traditional. u have to reduced ringer volume to zero.Sometimes glitches and lags are faced.May be i m facing this problem because i m still not able to explore phones setting menu completely.But it is value for money phone- light weight, best camera and good signal reception and voice quality."
4.0 , 31 May 2016,"Moto G 4 is good phone in with a good price tag.  However it's ownwed by lenovo still it shows its American DNA.

5.0 , 8 June 2016,"I have been using moto g4 plus 32gb variant for more than 2 weeks now,the  smartphone itself is brilliant,it has its ups and downs  The 16 megapixel shooter is brilliant with pro mode ,the 3000mah battery makes the device last long with 12hours of video playback, the mobile heats up during long time of camera usage,but still no problems, high end games like asphalt 8 , mortal kombat x and nova 3 works very well with no lag.The performance of this device is very good in terms of usage from day to night, turbo power charging enables the device to charge very fast, but use the turbo charger only when necessary because the device heat's up while charging through it, applications that you download cannot be moved to sd card and the motorola provided earphone is not worth the moneyIf you are a person who would want a great camera, good performance then the moto g plus (4th gen) is worth the money"

5.0 , 31 May 2016,"I have been using this Phone for a day and it works brilliantly. The phone heats up a bit during turbo charging but nothing to be worried about, it's normal...most phones heat up a little. (It does not heat up like an iron or anything... Those who say that it heats up like an iron have clearly not used an iron before) I used the internet at a stretch for about 4 and a half  hours or so and found no problems whatsoever... No lag, no overheating, The phone is fantastic.. I'd say go for it. It's the best phone you can get in this price range. If I had to nit pick I'd say the only thing that might be a problem is that the camera is slightly raised at the back so it might be more prone to scratches if u don't take care of it but that can be taken care of by using a cover.  Will give a detailed review after using it for a week."

4.0 , 7 June 2016,"Good performance. I like the display, the processing speed, the battery (turbo-charging is just great), camera is very useful, motion support for operations work really well, pure android.however there are some issue, focus of my review are those1) No led notification, which is really useful in a phone2) Heating, while charging and using internet3) Headphones are not good enough4) Lack of accesories5) Camera lens jut out a bit, prone to being damaged6) I did not like the quality of the flash as wellFinally till now this is the best phone that i have used ever. at 15000 this is a future proof phone with latest android and assurance of update. I have purchased this with a view of being able to use it for more than 2 years. I think it will serve me at least 2-3 years. I recommend this to all my friends and other readers of this review. Thanks."
5.0 , 1 June 2016,"Hi guys,There are ton of reviews at multiple places for this phone. So I am not going to make this a long one by comparing it with other phones.Pros:Display is one which competes with the big boys of Samsung &amp; Apple. Really sharp &amp; looks amazing even in sunlight.I am a fan of the memory (RAM) management of this phone.Fingerprint scanner works beyond belief. Super fast.Build quality is premium, even after the plastic back.Camera performance is also good.No bloatware. Stock android experience.Cons:Gets hot while turbo charging. Did not feel the phone heating up while moderate gaming of 30-40 mins.Earphones are a waste. Make sure you have a good earphone already or buy some good ones separately.Speakers are only OK.Voice quality has not been perfect over the calls."
4.0 , 6 June 2016,"Received the handset today so no genuine feedback of experience yet. But yes, I did not like the idea of opening the back panel every time to insert/remove the sim or sd card.2nd the packing by Green Mobiles was very worst. Flipkart is way ahead and far better than Amazon in this."

4.0 , 7 June 2016,"This is a MUST watch review if u are planning to buy a midrange smartphone.I bought lenovo moto g4+ after doing a lot of research and comparison betweem moto g4+,redmi note 3,zuk z1.The fact that i didn't purchased zuk z1 is firstly because of that old 32-bit processor ,yes it is clocked at a higher clockspeed of 2.5Ghz but it is still 32-bit and after an year or so many of the games and application will be unsupported as the dungeon hunter 4 is already not supporting and many more.secondly due to its low quality microphone,when recording videos the sound input taken by the microphone was insanely bad i saw that in every utube review.thirdly due to cyanogen mod!!yes it is the best custom ui available out there but it does exhibit ome lags bugs that could irritate u somewhile but for a power andadvanced user it is a plus point.Coming to the redmi note 3 ,the worst part is availability,u have to wait when will stock come and ol .secondly the redmi note 3 being a chinese brand every 4th or 5th cell phone is facing one or so issue u can read in reviews.thirdly miui is quite bloaty eats u 1.5gb from ur 3 gb ram and after installing facebook twitter and some other commons apps u r going to get 700-800mb of ram which will cause problems after the ota update to marshmallow(if it comes).fourthly the camera of redmi note 3 doesnt matches up to the class of zuk z1 and moto g4+.Now coming to MOTO G4+ the best camera in class,stock android so fluid experience with about 2gb ram remaining out of 3gb,available 99% of time,future proof with ota update of android N and O.(redmi and zuk z1 will only get updated to marshmallow dont think of N and O on them)now coming to heating issue of moto g4+,yes it heats up quite a bit but not that much thay is mentioned in other reviews,the thing to notice is that it's summers everywhere temp is around 45 or so ,a human is getting heated up then phone will do the same obviously even redmi does also heat up go and read recent reviews,during charging moto g4+ will not heat that much if u put your phone with camera upwards the heat will escape easily and the snapdragon 600 series chips always heats so no issue , i have given only 4 star because of the plastic built they should have included some metal atleast on the rims and border i think thats a con.lastly one word go for it!!!!!motog4+ is the winner"
5.0 , 4 June 2016,"I have Ordered this mobile on 25th may and got it on 27th. after using the mobile for more than a week i am writing this review. Initially i am in oscillation that whether to buy this mobile or not.Its all because of many negative reviews.after reading some review i have ordered 3GB variant. The mobile is awesome. Totally Value for money. The mobiles Special feature is its CAM. The Picture quality from both front and back CAM is Awesome.CAM : 16MP Rear and 5 MP FrontInternal Memory  : 25 GB for UserExternal Memory : upto 128 GBPerformance : since its having 3GB RAM there is no lagging and even High end apps are working without any lag.Screen : Its Corning Gorilla Glass. 5.5' inch and Supports HD.Charging : Since its having Turbo Charger. it take 1 hr 10 min to charge 100%.OTG Support : it support upto 128 GBThere is no LED notification in this mobile.Fingerprint Sensor : Its very fast as like Iphone 6S. the sensor is in front and it will not be act as Home key. For those claims it should be in back, Just think about the Iphones and one more thing the cost of placing this sensor in front higher than placing in back. That's why many brands place it in back.OS : Its packed with Android Marshmallow (Stock Version) and Guaranteed Upto for Android N and OProcessor : Snapdragon 617. very good performance.many says the mobile gets over heated while using CAM and playing High End Games.  but in my usage i feel little warm while playing high end games. That too maximum of 42 degree C. While charging and using CAM its very Cool( Tempt will be of 36-37 degree C). those who are saying that the mobile is getting overheat just update the firmware(around 150 MB) which might solve your problems.battery : 3000 MAh. the battery withstands 1 day for average use. Moto Satisfied me fully.Inside Box :Mobile, Turbo Charger, Headset and User manual.Headset is in Okay Level.Unfortunately the cable in the charger is fixed. So it can't be used as Data cable.Bottom Line : Awesome mobile from Moto and Totally value for Money. If you like just go for this."
3.0 , 1 June 2016,"Hi,The first impression i have got after seeing this phone is, it is not at all Moto phone.Build quality and look everything got changed. Very disappointed with build quality. It looks like it has very cheap plastic.As a customer of Moto from last 2.5 years, i have not yet felt that I am using a Moto phone.Pros: Display and screenFinger print sensor works very awesomeBloatware is reduced coming to earlier moto phonesthough sometimes switching between apps has a bit lag, overall it is super fast.Camera is very decent (both rear and selfie camera)Processing very fast.Cons: BatteryHeating while charging (I dont know whether it is the drawback in Turbo charging feature it self)Size (it is my personal opinion, i dont like phones which are bigger to 5 inches, but i dont have other option in this price bracket)Build qualityAll the above points are my personal view after using this phone for 1 week."

2.0 , 9 June 2016,"battery life is very poor and it is heating so much when data is on. not so good as expected..."
5.0 , 31 May 2016,"Well, I'll keep it as short as possible. I'll only pick up some important feature this phone offers.Firstly , the build quality is top notch. Although plastic takes up a lion's share in terms of material used.. the durability is good enough. With a metallic mix into this on the edges , the phone has an excellent design.Then, I'll jump to performance.The 3 GB RAM variant is an extremely fast phone. Multi-tasking seems to be good and running games (even the high graphic ones) seem to be buttery smooth. My phone is two days old now, and did not have any heating issues whatsoever, although i have been playing games like MC5, Fifa 16 and Nova 3. I'd really say the heating issue has been way too hyped , and the device runs high end games to perfection as of now. I faced a slight heating issue on Redmi Note 3 where that phone produced sidnificant lags while playing Nova 3. Overall , the gaming experience has been smooth.The camera..Well, this is probably the best thing happened to this phone. Although i am not very fond of cameras on mobile devices, this phone has impressed me every bit . To point out a weakness if i had to, I'd say the camera does not impress that much in low light situations. Apart from this it is of top notch.Fingerprint Sensor..Trust me, this phone has an astonishingly quick sensor. There has not been any detection problem and it detects the fingerprint fron any direction. Although, i don't really like the placement of the fingerprint sensor , as one will constantly mess it up with a home screen button. But, it takes a day to get used to it. So don't worry about it. It's fast, it's reliable.Battery..3000 mah battery , lasts for like 30 hours with normal usage. I have been stuck to games since  the start, and still the battery managed to last around 16 hours , which is pretty descent.Overall experience..The phone handles multitasking with ease, and thats pretty much everything i asked for from a mid range device. The battery isn't the best comparing other phones which offer bigger batteries at this price range, but the smooth performance of this phone makes up for it. The phone faces a stiff competition with the likes of Redmi note 3 and Lenovo ZUK Z1 into the mix, but still if i had to go for one of them, i would pick the moto any time of the day.PS- Thanks to Amazon. Quick delivery, never disappoints. Keep it up."

5.0 , 2 June 2016,"Using since 1 week. First of all about the heating issues, I have not faced any serious heating issues, Yes mobile gets warm while charging as it charges the Cellphone very fast around 90-100 mins. I have played Nova 3 for around 30-40 mins and there was no heating. My wifi remains Active for whole day and while using normally like Videos, Music, and normal applications the phones does not heat up.I am using both the sims one on 3G and other on 2G and battery last up-to one day . Overall Gaming performance is good, but on Asphalt 8 on high settings cellphone hot little warm but that is well understood and is avoidable.Best part is Camera and turbo charging. Only thing I did not life is Volume Rocker button is to tactile and feels cheap. Fingerprint works flawlessly."
5.0 , 28 May 2016,"First I have to say that the delivery time is just excellent. Got the delivery within 3 days &amp; the handset is just great within this price range and the performance is awesome . Yes, it does tend to get a little hot but that is no problem for me. It can run heavy games without any lags and got an OTA update within 1 day of usage &amp; this is the perks for using stock android. About the packaging which is good but not great because there was no bubble wrappings. I am giving this 5 out of 5 stars because the delivery time and the product quality is excellent even though there was no bubble wrappings. Finally it would be great if it was packed with an Adreno 510 GPU which I was expecting. But none the less go for it, you will not regret it.I am in love with this device."

Screen quality is great.. battry backup is good.. camera is the usp of this phone.. finger print sensor is working great and unlocks the phone as fast as iphone's touch id or any other flagships touch sensor.. this phone is one of the or i can say that the best phone under 25k.

5.0 , 26 May 2016,"Close your eyes and buy it. Its awesome phone. It was quoted in Indiatoday site that this phone competes I-Phone 6S camera and yes It does compete. Its above average camera. Good battery backup. Touch is too much responsive. Fingerprint is again awesome but I would have preferred it at back. Its faster then Redmi Note 3. Best thing is that whenever there is a new android rolled in the market, Moto G4 Plus buyers will surely get an update of  it. Get ready for Android N and Android O. Looks are not that good but still its ok. Turbo charging is awesome. It supports OTG. No splashproof or waterproof so get rid that thinking before you buy it. Battery back up is ok. It lasts till 1 day at an average use. It heats up a bit but not at that great extend like some of them have reviewed here. My suggestion is you should go for it."
4.0 , 8 June 2016,"Before getting this phone I read a lot of reviews ..amazon customer reviews ..I was a little apprehensive. But guys..this phone is value for money!!So here are my findings :Pros: 1. Camera is great !!  I compared it myself with iPhone6S and believe me it is indeed better.Low light performance is ok.2.  It is working smooth as of now. No lagging.. no hanging issues.3. Fingerprint Sensor is just awesome!4. Gesture controls are soo cool. One shake and the flash light turns on.5. FM can be played on speaker. No headphones required. Cons:1. Battery charge lasts 9hrs2. Heats up while charging. Although doesn't heat up on normal use.3. Could not find option to create folders on main screen."
4.0 , 14 June 2016,"Cons.1. Normal uses just heats the phone up.2. Battery seems to be draining faster.3. Dolby not supported - hoping it will be supported in the nest update.4. No led light activated.Pros.1. Turbo charging and all others are good"

4.0 , 31 May 2016,"Plus is Impressive specifications and battery, wish my iPhone had a battery like this. Minus is absence of screen customisation for the large screen and no other use for finger print reader other than finger print reading. UI is usual moto which is slightly boring."
5.0 , 1 June 2016,"This is the best phone under 25000 rupees. All the Xaomi and One Plus in the market can try their best but still cant match the quality and accuracy of the product.High points: 1. Camera quality  2. Lag free smooth performance  3. Call quality  4. Screen brightness and colour reproduction.  5. Quality of the finger-print sensor, it is fast and accurate.All the concerns on heating while gaming  and charging are baseless. We should remember this is a phone , neither a xbox console nor a professional camera. So we should not overdo of gaming and photographing. Even if we do , it is not malfunctioning only heating mildly. We should be able to live with it. Even my iphone 6s plus heats up on continuous gaming and photography."
5.0 , 1 June 2016,"Pros:Classy phone with gr8 looks, sleek to handle, vibrant in display, silky in touch, booster in hardware, fantastic in picture quality... thumps to motog4plus, would highly recommend.Cons:I found that phone gets heated only while charging."
5.0 , 1 June 2016,"this phone is really good.for any query- [...][...]1-fingerprint sensor is very very fast.2-25 gb available space3-front firing speakers4-  it will become hot when battery charges from 78 to 88% after 88 % it cools down to the hundred percent5- it is true that phone is very little little warm while using but it doesn't matter because Moto has given us the best camera you ever had in the price of 150006-Using moto g4 plus for 2 days and played a games like ashpalt Nova 3 mortal combat 5 and xPhone doesn't get heatup.It was only warm. Just like when you play games on pc.As the temp in India is very high.that's why it gets little bit heatup sometimes7- charges the full phone in 1 hr 40 min from 10 percent"
4.0 , 11 June 2016,"Let me start with drawback as there are only few.....Cons:1.Charges very fast but with a little bit of heat while its getting charged2.Another drawback is that  battery goes to10% hours3.Moto camera could have been better.4.missing Gallery unlike in another Android phones but compensated with Google photosPros:1.Touch is what am extremely happy about.... feather touch2.Finger print sensor3.Quickly can glimpse through notification without opening the lock4.Very decent UI.

4.0 , 29 May 2016,"The phone is very good from holding perspective. light in weight, sleek.It does have heats up during turbo charging. It has worked smoothly as till now.Camera is as good as claimed. one of the best i can say in 16 mp segment. front camera is also very good.Coz of only single speaker it does not have a very powerful volume output in speaker mode but music quality in headphones is very good.No problems of signal and good high voice volume in calling, which is a problem in many phones as they have very low calling voice volume.But the earphones provided by Moto in the box is not up to the mark.Overall i did like this phone which is a very cost effective and worth the money.."

2.0 , 14 June 2016,"It has been two days since i am using it. Following things i want to make aware to people before they go for it to purchase.1. All there music lover, its a pathetic product. The sound quality in earphone given with box is very bad, also as well as with other earphone or headphone.2. I found that in my device the earphone slot is not compatible with standard earphone plugs. For making earphone to work i has too argest the plug to little outside. Means earphone never works at first time, it will work only after few more attempts. Which is really bad process. For such a hipped phone.3. The plug of earphone is way too much outside to plugin. Really bad design.I am thinking for a replacement."
5.0 , 29 May 2016,"It reached within time and the packaging was good from the seller.If we talk about the phone, its "Amazing" in this price category.The camera functions, specially the professional mode is exceptional. And the "laser autofocus" is a outstanding addition to the camera of this price-range phone. Fingerprint sensor is working quite smoothly. I have tried a few high end games like Asphalt 8, Real Racing 3, all are running without any lag. The fast charging adopter is my favorite thing, it helps the phone to be alive for atleast 4 hours in just 10 mins.Matt finished back is really cool and feels good while using... over-all its a cheap and best deal moto and Lenovo is offering together."

At first I thought its the IDEA network giving issue but then there was no breaking of voice its total mute from both sides. It only gets resolved when I restart the phone.Phone gets heated up while Charging also and not sure as I dnt use it extensively for any other activity for longer time.Camera is good but the pictures are not so fine in quality.Touch is good and smooth and handset is light weight."

3.0 , 30 May 2016,"I ordered the phone (3GB RAM version) the moment the sale was opened on 18th May. But the delivery was little delayed.  I have been using this phone for the past 5 days. Display is nice. Camera app hangs sometimes if you navigate fast through the camera menu, Images are good when the light is good. Phone hangs if the temperature increases. The temperature goes up to 50 degree Celsius while charging. Turbo charger is slightly faster than 1.5A output charger.  Finger print works fine. There is no music player other than Google play music which doesn't feature folder menu. I would recommend to download Pi Music player from play store. The app is too good. On the whole, it is a decent phone."
4.0 , 29 May 2016,"Frustrated over the flash sale on redmi note 3 i bought this mobile. Greatmobile for the price. It doesn't look so premium but has its positive side in the stock android experience and for the googles updates on the os. Its light weight and slim, good battery life, no lags or whatsoever. No complaints over the camera...touch is very smooth and fast.Turbo charger charges the mobile very fast. But gets hot while playing games or using some apps and while charging. Other than that its a great mobile. Finger print sensor works flawlessly. You can definitely buy it but keep in mind the heating issue...perhaps it will be reduced over the future updates👍👍👍"

3.0 , 14 June 2016,"Exepcted a lot from this device and it stood up to my expectations upto some point. Excellent camera, Very good battery backup, almost stock android interface, really fast fingerprint sensor that detects your fingerprint 99/100 times, snappy performance most of the time!However this phone has a major con of over-heating! Temperature of the phone rises very much especially while using camera or playing games as a result of which the phone starts to show major lag and becomes unusable. I saw this mostly in about 15 about minutes of camera use. Rest Moto G 4th Gen is an amazing phone! Really a bang for the buck!"

5.0 , 29 May 2016,"I have been using it for 2-3 weeks I purchased it on day one of launch ..I came to order another phone for my friend but a 4* rating for this phone was disturbing..It's an excellent device , good weight and grip , camera is brilliant , FP sensor is very responsive , use the thumb ..definitely deserves a 4.5* at least... Even after long playing heating is nominal ..like any other 5.5 inch screen phone ...I'm still to find a flaw in the phone ..yes there's one it doesn't have a rocket launcher"
3.0 , 11 June 2016,"The expectations were on the higher side.Thought the camera will be more influential however it is not.And also the battery back up is also not good.The major problem is the HEAT UP problem. Everytime i put the phone on charging or using wifi or internet or even listening songs the phone will heat up like it is soon going to blast.Also from where I can get the screen shot option ?And why the top light isn't blinking ?How can i get a picture clicked with eyes blink or by showing hand or something like this.I guess we dont have any option in it."
5.0 , 24 May 2016,"Pros: Guyz.. Don't check for other phones. I purchased this phone after selling my LG G4. Trust me, everything is on par with LG except Camera. Although, it's not right to compare 34k Phone with 15K. But, ya...Camera is best amongst all phones under 20K range. While taking this phone, I was worried about the Camera quality in low light, but I am fully satisfies with the Camera.Battery and Gaming performance: Battery is above average with maximum On screen time of 5 hrs 20 min. While, Gaming is also very gud.Finger Print Scanner(FPS): It is very good. To expand it's usage in unlocking the application, you can download App Lock by Keepsafe application from play store. It works like a charm. If u still have any doubt about the FPS, reply on this review.Cons: Phone heats a little bit while playing heavy games but it didn't impact battery performance(degradation), gaming performance or charging.  FPS should work as home button, even you guys can get confuse in the early days.. But, because of its accuracy and speed, I m ok with the FPS.Conclusion: Lenevo has really done a great job here. As, we know Motorola is known for stock android performance. Yes, the phone meets the brand expectation. No lags, hanging issue occurs so far. I am using this from 20th May and it is great. If you have budget upto 20k, close ur eyes and go for it. Also, don't get confuse with Note 3, meizu or Zuk Z1. I have done all the research before buying it and I am fully satisfied. Even, Motorola guarantees it's update upto ANDROID O."

3.0 , 11 June 2016,"[...]Its an official forum thread of Motorola for G4 plus heating issue see for yourself. Over-Heating issue is a problem complained by many users here, because it happening even without extensive use.(2-5 min of video recording with stabilisation on is not an extensive use which makes whole camera UI phone UI to hang). The community is trying to fix the issue but till then 3 star for this "awesome" phone. It has a fabulous camera and all other features are at par which makes this mobile king of this sub 15k price range but just the overheating issue is pulling it down. Hope next firmware update fixes ."
