5.0 , 4 November 2015,"iPhone 5s was first released 2 years ago in November 2014.I am still a fan of iPhone 5s, over newer 6 or 6s. It's much cheaper then iphone 6 and 6s, but with all the same features including fingerprint authentication and a powerful 64-Bit processor. If a bigger screen is not your priority then this is a good cheaper iPhone.Now the important Question: Is it original with India Warranty?Answer: YES. I bought it from 'Gadgets_Guru' seller. Took phone to Authorized Apple service center, and got it verified, It had valid 1 year warranty in India.Printed price on box is Rs.35,000 and I got it from amazon for Rs.28,300.UPDATE: Apple has further reduced price of iPhone 5s, and is now available around Rs.21,500. The price keep fluctuating between Gold, Silver and Black color, make sure you check price for all the colors.Side note: The box came with 2.1 Ampere Charger, which comes with iPhone 6s and iPad. Previously iPhones use to ship with 1-Ampere charger, and I believe apple is now putting same 2.1 Ampere Charger with old generation iPhone too. This is a GOOD THING, it charges twice as fast.--One last thing, Please hit YES Button if you found my review HELPFUL"
5.0 , 28 April 2016,"The phone was delivered within 2 days.This phone was priced at 55k last year, however, due to ihpne 6 being launched, I managed to get it for 18k. Which is a fabulous deal.The phone: I always felt that apple was extremely arrogant with its one ecosystem policy. I've used Lumia, Android (multiple devices) and even the synogen phones for a while. I now understand the power of design.Screen Size - PerfectBattery - Yes, it drains out quite fast, but that is only because of the background applications. Turn them off (Doesn't make sense to have them on as they anyway update within seconds once you activate the app) and switch to low power mode. Lasts for more than a day.Space - 16GB was adequate space for me because I need 5GB for music and another 5 for apps and pictures (which i transfer to my laptop- google drive etc quite often)System - As smooth as butter. I LOVE the fingerprint scanner. Makes life a breeze. Considering how integrated our lives are to mobile phones these days, the flawless design and smooth functionality of this phone has reduced stress levels. i did not just buy a tool for communication and accessing applications. I bought a stress buster - which is probably going to add a few years to my life. Unless I die in a freak accident or overdose of cocaine."
5.0 , 8 May 2016,"I switched from iPhone 4 to 5s and this phone is really really great for the price it is being sold at right now. Would totally recommend it to peeps who wanna use an iPhone but have a low budget. The camera, processing speed, game play, body weight and size is great for a correctly sized (mostly known as small sized) phone. Before opening the box I checked the IMEI number on apple's website and the phone was showing as not activated, and after setting up my phone I checked it again and it was showing me a years date for limited warranty from the day I started using it, hence it's a brand new, untouched, sealed pack phone. Thanks to the seller for that."
4.0 , 9 February 2016,"In the past 4 years I have owned Android and (the now virtually redundant) Blackberry phones prior to buying an iPhone 5s last year. Overall I prefer the iPhone over the others and would recommend it, with a few minor reservations.The iPhone 5s is superior in these areas:1. The design is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use2. The screen is fantastic; big enough to be really useful but small enough for the phone to be easily pocketable. The Blackberry screen was maybe too small for most applications except for email, and the Android too big and heavy for portable use. I particularly like the long narrow screen on the 5s3. A lot of thought has gone into the way a user can navigate around the screen through the different functions. I have owned an iPod Touch for a couple of years and have become a fan of Apple's clear and simple graphics: on the 5s, it's even better. The software never crashes, which it did with both my Android phones frequently4. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, the on-screen keypad of the 5s is really well designed - especially true if you use the phone in landscape format which has the effect of widening the keypad. In comparison, the Android was frustrating and not very user-friendly and the Blackberry Storm completely hopeless - though the permanent keypad on the Curve was great5. The ring tone &amp; speaker volume is louder and clearer on the iPhone than any of its rivals6. Phone reception is the best. I don't know how Apple manage this, but I have made and received calls in locations where other phones don't seem to work - like travelling on the London underground and in deep underground car parks7. The camera is so good it's up to the standard of a dedicated Canon or Nikon compact, for the first time on a cellphone8. The memory (64GB) is vast, with a storage capacity so huge you're never likely to need more no matter what you download and store on it9. Siri, iMessage and Facetime are genuinely useful apps, not just gimmicks. They actually work well. The fingerprint scanner works too, though how much of a real security feature this is remains doubtfulGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn't great, but no worse than the Android Galaxy 4 and you can substantially improve it on the 5s by turning off power-hungry applications2. The unique nano-SIM means you can't swap the SIM over to another phone in an emergency, or for example if the phone is damaged and needs repairOverall I have become a reluctant Apple convert. It's easy to see why they have become market leader with such an excellent product. Of course in another 2 or 3 years the tech will have moved on again, there may be a new market-leading manufacturer and the 5s will be an antique. But until then, except the 64 bit architecture the 5s for me is the King of cellphones in 20k budget.(ignoring unreliable Chinese brandsFinally, a lot of reviews posted on amazon are from buyers who are unable to transfer their data from android. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints. The solution is easy: buy from an Apple store and they'll set up the new iPhone for you and transfer all the data from your old phone or search on you tube and learn the way to do it.Tip- Please buy from amazon fulfilled seller for genuine phones.Thanks for your time."

5.0 , 3 May 2016,"I HAVE NOT BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON BUT THIS PHONE IS FANTASTIC PHONE. I HAVE 3 5S IN MY HOME. GOLD 32GB IS USED BY MY WITH AND OTHER TWO SPACE GREY AND SILVER ARE USED BY ME. THEY ARE REALLY WORTH BUYING. EVERY PENNY I SPENT ON THEM IS WORTH. I DONT PUT CASES ON MY PHONE WHICH LEAVE ME WITH WONDERFUL FEELING OF HOLDING SUCH A FINELY CRAFTED PHONE.I BOUGHT TWO 5S IN 2016, ITS ALMOST 3 YEARS SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION BUT I BET NONE OF YOU CAN FEEL THE SLUGGISHNESS IN THE PHONE ON NORMAL DAY TO DAY USAGE. I PLAY GRAPHIC INTENSE GAMES LIKE NOVA 3 AND MODERN COMBAT 5, BOTH RUNS PREETY GOOD.FOR ME BEING A 5S ADDICT CANT FIGURE OUT A SINGLE FAULT IN THIS PHONE. ANYONE CAN LIVE WITH THIS PHONE HAPPILY."
5.0 , 5 November 2014,"Giving feedback after using iPhone 5S last 25 days. I ordered this phone on Amazon Diwali Dhamaka deal @ 29999. I got amazing deal with best price. It is brand new genuine apple iPhone in sealed box with accessories having apple India warranty. I did not have any problem till date."
1.0 , 24 December 2015,"I had returned the i phone on the very fourth day of my purchase as there if flow of electricity near the charging port during charging and it is also giving mild electrical shock when touched there bare foot. When tested with a tester the light in it glowing brightly so much electricity the rear body is pumping out. Please see the photo attached. This is the quality of the so called i phone. Beware every one.Also this is a genuine product as I verified from apple site. Apple should not deliver to this country such third grade products without testing their quality.The plus point is service of Amazon is excellent."
1.0 , 31 October 2015,"Fake tool"
5.0 , 19 July 2015,"Delivery: On time and good packing by sellers GadgetDirect and ThinkGeek.Warranty: Checked the serial number on Apple site and no problem with 1 year warranty from the date I activated phone.Performance: 10/10Stability: 9/10Consistency: 10/10Looks: 10/10Sound: 9/10Camera: 8/10Design: 10/10Privacy Control: 10/10Battery Backup: 7/10Compatibility: 2/10Overall: 8.5 out of 10.(+) Performance - Apple designs both hardware and software so even the seemingly ordinary specs deliver vertex of performance.(+) Stability - No abnormal reboot or termination of applications. This phone doesn't hang.(+) Consistency - What performance and stability you are getting today, it won't diminish with time. Your phone remains same after months and years.(+) Looks - I have Space Grey color. The appearance is ineffable, I'd call it verbatim beauty.(+) Sound - Crisp and clean. Speakers are loud enough without leaking the sound. Put it close to ears and you will hear delicate punches of bass!(+) Camera - Don't expect SLR segment. Snaps in day and night both can be tagged on decent mark.(+) Design - 4" is business elegance. Comfortable to hold and operate by single hand. This could be last offering from Apple in 4" segment.(+) Privacy Control - One must factor that this phone delivers. No application can play stunts accessing any of your information without permission.(+) Battery Backup - Around 22 hours with normal usage and WiFi on. Charging takes 2 hours.(-) Compatibility - This is where new users need to think. You can't just connect a USB cable and copy files in a trice from PC. Peering with any other phone is not available. Apple talks with Apple devices or through safe passage of iTunes. However, these constraints only give Apple the matchless stability and security.Deficiencies:Apple map is not accurate so download Google map which is a minute worth task. Siri is not fluent with Indian accent as Google voice but she tries to learn. The text keyboard has odd placement of period (.) key, it's in in numerics keypad which is bit tedious while composing emails and message. On few 32 GB handsets there may be a slight yellow tint. Apple support claims its just the color profile / variance and not an issue. Depends now on user if they get adjusted as it might make their color preference look better. I though opted a neutral one. Last, this is a very delicate gadget and need to be handled carefully or with protective covers. "A drop can result exorbitant repair charges."Final Say:This phone has the outstanding combination of consistent performance and appearance. If compatibility is not an issue then this phone by no means would let you down on the paid price. IOS 9 will enhance the performance further as it will be half the size of IOS 8."

5.0 , 10 February 2016,"It's a genuine phone.Checked before unboxing the phone.Check here https://checkcoverage.apple.com/in/en/It will show 'Device not activated yet' then it is a genuine and new phone with full 1 year warranty.If it shows some info like warranty period that means its a used phone.Not sure what it will show about duplicate phone.If you face any issues after receiving a genuine iPhone you have to contact apple service center.Using this phone for more than 2 months.

5.0 , 12 April 2016,"Sweet phone, ordered it as soon as the price dropped to 21.5K. Running ios 9.2 now, smooth and clean.Would not recommend the 16 GB version since you will definitely run into space issues very very fast. Consider the 32 GB version, the extra dough is definitely worth spending for an additional 16GB space. 16 GB works for me coz I am not a heavy app/music user. My requirement is around running basic apps with some social networking and messaging. Phone meets my requirements perfectly.Amazon service and delivery was up to the mark. No delays and good packing. So 5 Star!!"
5.0 , 27 March 2016,"Best phone experience i ever had.Prior to switching to apple i have been using android devices. They are cheaper as compared to the apple devices and have good hardware but the problem is that these devices were lagging a lot.iphone charges very quickly as compared to my android phone which had more battery as compared to apple iphone 5s but still i had to charge the device 3 - 4 times. With iphone 5s i need to do a single charge for moderate use. If i keep the device in sleep mode the battery last for more than a day.Also the look and feel of the device is very superior. Up to the mark as it is an apple deviceCamera quality is excellent.The best part of ios is that even if you 20 apps running in background it doesn't hangs. I have tried playing games with various apps running in the background but still the games runs smoothly.The reception and the voice quality is very superiorI suggest each one should try an apple device once in their lifetime"

Bought from them many times even before.This phone is amazing. Best phone ever. For 17500 I could not have expected a better quality of phone. I agree there are better RAM, memory, etc available but believe me this is more than enough.I charge phone at night and, in Mumbai with fluctuating range, battery is at 62% at 9 pm. Do I care if it is just 1500mAh?Phone never hangs. And no limit to multitasking.  It doesnt matter if it is not 2GB or 3 GB.Display is awesome. Camera fantastic. Screen size takes time to get used to. But believe me no complains.Remember this phone people were lining up to buy for 40-45 thousand rupees. This 17500 is great!!!Better this phone than useless Chinese companies which dont even last a year ( my Xiaomi). Better this phone than expensive phones worth my monthly salary."

I love 4' screen size)Screen quality (Sharpness, Responsiveness, Sunlight legibility): 9/10 (Good viewing angles)Weight: 9/10 (Feels solid yet easy to carry)Accessibility: 10/10 (Single handed use)SOFTWARE:IOS Operating System: 9/10 (Easy to use but not very customizable, however very fluid &amp; doesn't hang)IOS Echosystem: 9/10 (Well connected, as per my personal &amp; business needs. More than sufficient for most of us, I guess.)Sound Quality: 10/10 (Excellent quality seen in a mobile device, not like HTC boom sond but comparable)Network Reception: 9/10 (Clear &amp; crisp)App Store: 10/10 (Got all apps I generally use)Battery: 9/10 (I consider myself a heavy user as my business depends on my phone but strangely it plays smooth for a full day (with wifi on, always) also, It does not get warm while charging, however it does while playing games (heavy games))So as you can figure out, I am happy on my decision to switch to IOS. I hope this review would be helpful in the decision making process for new users."
5.0 , 24 December 2015,"I ordered my Apple iPhone 5s Silver 16GB on Christmas day i.e. 25th Dec 2015 at 3:30 PM. I applied for the 1-day delivery at the checkout and sealed the deal. To my amazement, I received the phone in Delhi properly sealed and in a great packaged condition at 4:30 PM the next day. That was really very swift from both the seller and the delivery people. Received my phone in dot 25 hours was indeed impressive. Now coming to the iPhone, let me reiterate that it is an amazing machine and here is a fun fact. It was the last Apple device Steve Jobs worked on. And we can see for ourselves how badly iPhone 6 and 6s have fared. The 4-inch screen is a bliss and the grip on the hand is great. Even the pocket feels nice and easy when the iPhone is in it. Not like the bulky brick sized plus editions. Now coming to the battery. I got a Nov 2015 phone. Thats means I received a new iPad like charger which has a rating of 10W rather than the old chargers that used to come with the iPhone launched in Sep 2013. The old charger had a rating of 5W. So I can call myself lucky to charge my phone in a short span of time. Regarding the storage I reckon 16GB is good amount of space as I usually have my device connected to my iPad and Macbook. So shifting and clearing space is not an issue. I was previously using Moto G 3rd Gen and I agree the battery backup of the iPhone is no match to that of the Moto. But be rest assured that the iOS 9.1 that comes preloaded with the phone is fun. It's smooth and really very user-friendly. Lastly, if you guys are confused about the colour, let me tell you that the Champagne Gold colour and its production has been officially stopped by Apple. So unnecessary hoarding and demand-supply factors have led to an exorbitantly high price approx 6-8k higher than Silver and Space Grey. Don't go for Space Grey as it is after all an iPhone guys and you don't buy a Jaguar to keep it in the garage forever, would you? So my suggestion is that go for the Silver colour. It definitely looks more upmarket than the other two options. Enjoy with the purchase guys! Apple won't let you down!!!"
5.0 , 18 December 2015,"Firstly when I ordered it for just 21.49K i was very exited to have it! But then after ordering i read some fake reviews that were on to amazon wich said they received fake device! Wich was all fake reviews the device that i got was 100% genuine no doubt!!!Now about the device...its been 2 years since 5S was launched and still it runs the lattest version of iOS 9.2 that awesome about iOS still there are very minor lags wich you will barely notice! It handles my everyday work perfectly!! No doubt you won't regret after buying!!! The camera is good! The touch ID its very useful I really don't remember when I unlocked my iPhone with passcode last!! And it's also remarkably thin and light!! Best phone after all its apple!! I had a one plus 2, moto x play, nexus4,moto g 3rd gen and a yu yureka! And its sad that i wasted my money on shuch s***ty android devices now I know iPhone just for once cost much but is u get a gr8 deal on that you won't and shouldn't stop!!! Love this phone!!! Thanks Tim!!:)"
1.0 , 1 October 2015,"Hi.After using it for 1 week.I don't think it's wise to spend 30 k on this product. The phone heats up quite easily. You can iron a cloth. Battery back up is horrible. With 3/4G on it can hardly last for more than 5 hrs. Not recommended.God knows what for people appreciate this phone so much."
5.0 , 24 December 2015,"Reseller feedback - Though I received my iPhone without any delay however outer packing was pretty ordinary however product was intact. It was properly sealed and courier guy helped me opening the pack so that we can check any damage. Must improve packing "Thebluedeals" reseller.Product Review - I received the phone on 20th Dec'15 and so far the phone is working fine with no issue. Post activating I checked the serial number on apple website and this is a genuine purchase. It is brand new genuine apple iPhone in sealed box with accessories having apple India warranty. I did not have any problem till date.Price Deal - I got this product for rs 22500 which is lowest prices in past 2-3 weeks comparing (Amazon, Snapdeal &amp; Flipkart).Recommendation - Guys must check re-sellers feedback &amp; rating. And believe me you can trust Amazon.com and beware of fake feedbacks.Thank you Amazon for a great deal and awesome product."
5.0 , 10 May 2015,"Earlier I used to think why people use to spend 40k-45k just for a 5-inch mobile phone..But using for about 1 month, I found the reason behind that. I liked the shape and design, metallic back panel especially, its OS and display, feature of touch ID and facetime, front HD camera. Now I think I've wasted 4 years using Android. A must buy for those, who just not use their phones but love them."
5.0 , 21 April 2016,"Can't complain anything. If you are looking for specs , you are looking at a wrong product, but if you are looking for smooth uninterrupted performance, this is the phone to go for. Coming from android, I really enjoyed the apple experience to say the least.Definitely going to be an IOS user from now on. The build is just sturdy, compact and appealing."
3.0 , 31 October 2014,"After working fine for few days.  Phone started to hang on to camera app.  WhatsApp is not working smoothly pics are taking too much time and uploading getting failed also.  Something is wrong.  Talked to Amazon customer care.. As now 10 days are over so I need to visit apple store.  Hopefully they will the accept product as genuine and do the needful."

And now I'm writing this review from the same iPhone ! iPhone is good and perfect ! I've checked the warranty on apple website and it clearly telling me that my iPhone is genuine ! Thanks Amazon !"
1.0 , 31 March 2016,"Awful, the first phone had a defect with the audio while video recording, heating up is also a major issue with battery fluctuations.  On replacement,  they have sent a worst one with low incoming voice, same previous defect. Please don't buy from here, the product is not worth the money. And now they are refusing to even replace again."
5.0 , 7 January 2016,"Pros:Great phone.Flawless .works smooth and touch is also very fluid.IOS 9.2 comes out of the box that makes the Phone come alive.The camera is awesome compared to the competitors, don't get fooled by the lower pixels even the front cam takes sharp vibrant images.The product was manufactured and imported in December 2015.Factory unlocked .Registered it after opening the box have one year of apple warranty.Accessories are good , I guess I got the 10w charger which was supplied with iPad.Cons:Just an issue which most of Indian user may experience.During charging if u place the phone upside down and rub the aluminum back you will feel a gentle vibration.I don't think that's an big issue as i think its due to the improper grounding and so.Will update after using it a month.Great switch from android to ios.. Loving it."
5.0 , 27 January 2016,"I was looking for another phone to replace by ageing blackberry bold. I already have a samsung note 4 so wanted to try Apple. As this model was within budget I bought this. Overall experience is very smooth. Iphone has its advantages of sleek build and good os in a compact body. So no issues there. However, if I compare with my Note 4 then I feel Samsung Note is much better value. The Note 4 is as quick and lag free as iphone plus has advantages of the s-pen and brilliant screen. Here you can add an sd card to expand memory which you cannot do with iphone. So overall i will recommend Note 4 over this even if Note 4 is slightly more expensive. Also, there is rumor that Apple may be releasing a new 4 inch iphone soon that is why prices are being slashed on iphone 5s to clear stock so you may want to wait for that. Buy this if compact size is important to you. Otherwise, Note 4 is a better phone all over."

5.0 , 4 September 2014,"I5s is the best phone in the market, this I agree now. Only when you buy an apple device then only you realise why it's so much better than android or the stylish Windows phone. It's simply brilliant. Easy to use, superbly customised and a lavish look. This space grey model is more attractive.Plus, amazon does a great job.Full deserving 5stars for a wonderful product! 😊😊😊😊😊"
5.0 , 28 January 2015,"Awesome product from Apple ever. I had purchased this product from Amazon to add upto my apple environment at home. At first I was little worried whether to purchase it from e-retail store or from some offline store as most of the e-comm websites including Amazon did not mention anything about 4G support which is the main reason I am upgrading from Samsung S4. Since I found a great deal from Amazon I booked it on the night of January 25th. Then I had sent my query to Cloudtail, who is the selling this product in Amazon. Amazing thing is I got an instant reply from the Cloudtail about its 4G compatibility. I got the product delivered to me on January 26th Morning even though I did not opt for express service. The product is 100% genuine apple iPhone. It is imported version and it is compatible to Airtel 4G LTE services. As Airtel uses 2300Mz range for 4G services or Band-40. Most of the imported phones especially imported from US are not supported in India 4G services.Thanks for Amazon for providing me best deal and amazing experience."

5.0 , 7 February 2015,"I will not post a review about the phone since the whole lot of customers and the experts  have already done that. Instead I will stick with the basics, item was received in perfect condition. No issues so far. I have been using it for more than 6 months now. Seller is genuine, shipping was fast and yes I have warranty ."
4.0 , 15 November 2015,"I ordered this phone from amazon on 09 Nov 2015 and it was delivered on 12 Nov 2015. Phone is in absolutely in New condition. Phone runs fine and there is not such a major issue with it. But two things I noticed about this phone1. First was that left speaker in the bottom of phone produces extremely low sound or I may say that It's not working at all.2. Second one is when I play NFS on iPhone for 5-10 minutes it's back start heating (not very high but noticeable). Although the issue of speaker doesn't bother me as rarely I use speakers and the sound is coming perfect in the earphone. The other speaker is already working for producing good sound (But the second one should also have been working).Overall a good experience with phone with features and price but a bit disappointed with the non working speaker and heating slighting while playing game."
3.0 , 1 February 2016,"Well product and delivery was good but the main concern is the heating of the phone, whenever im using 3g, watsp call or surfing. It is getting very hot, it happens in most of the phones but i was not expecting it from i phone, buy it dont use it for internet use. Now im planning to buy a tab for internet use. 😐😁👎🏻"

Checked the serial numbers online in the apple website, seems legit. Good performance, excellent camera and the look of the phone is simply stunning. Got it at a discounted price, simply loved the colours and the finish. Liked it much more than iPhone 6, overall a very satisfactory buy. Thank you Amazon."
5.0 , 29 February 2016,"Got a brand new phone - manufactured Feb 2016, delivered in 2016. MRP is Rs 25000, so looks like Apple has dropped the prices of 5s yet again, but still got a great price @ 21k. Go for it if you are confused with too many android options. Screen now looks small after usign phones of screen size &gt; 4.7 inch.."
4.0 , 23 April 2016,"I have been using this phone since 1 month and now I'm gonna update my views about this product. However the product delivery was fine (One day late) and got original iPhone from Apple. I selected this product over iPhone 6 because personally I don't like the design of iPhone 6 or 6S and this iPhone have great design. I got the fresh iPhone 5S Silver but I guess my phone has an issue. My iPhone got heated when I go outside in this summer and during the charge of phone it get overheated.  So that's only the issue that I'm facing other wise it is superb phone. Below I'm gonna mention some Pros and Cons for your knowledge.PROS:1] Doesn't hang2] Looks Stylish3] You will get frequent upgrades of iOS (I updated it to iOS 9.3.1 from iOS 9.2.1) compare to Android.4] Camera Quality is Superb (Front and Rear)5] You can make Slow Motion Video (I loved it)6] Sound quality can beat any Android phone7] Fingerprint Scanner works smoothly8] Health Monitor tracks your activities9] Earphone design looks awesome and it's quality tooCONS:1] Heating Issue (My iPhone get heated during charging and when I go outside in this summer. I don't know if you get can get a piece with no heating issue. Because I have seen it is a one of common problem in iPhone)2] Shots in flash may not seem good3] Limited and Paid Application"
5.0 , 28 March 2016,"It justifies its tag line "If you don't have an iPhone. You don't have an iPhone.". I always wanted to have an iPhone but the pricing was so high, that I could never afford one. Finally Apple has decided the reduce the prices of its previous versions of iPhone. I have used Nexus 4 in the past which is a very premium looking phone with glass back panel. But once you hold an iPhone in your hand, you actually feel the difference. Someone correctly pointed out that an iPhone is not just a phone its an extension of you. This phone is just too awesome. The internals might not be top notch but one thing is for sure, as far as performance is concerned it will give any other phone at this price range a run for the money. The best part of this phone is the quality of its camera. I am regular DSLR user and I never click pictures with my phone, ever. But the camera of this compact beast made me rethink. Even the 1.2 MP front camera produces crisp selfies. The UI of the phone is very simple to use. The finger print reader itself is better than any other phone's. The Retina Display is gorgeous. Produces accurate colors at any angle. So if you ever wanted to own an iPhone of your own, just go for it. You will not regret the decision."
