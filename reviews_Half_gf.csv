1, 27 October 2014,"Chetan! Chetan! Who are you?Where are you headed, do you have a clue?I bought your book and read it through,Trust me dear, there is nothing new!A horny hero and a pretty heroine,A prestigious college, stereotypic routine!The story line is an absolute miss,Front page ad in TOI, for a book like this?The back cover talks about Hindi and English,All that is just plain marketing rubbish.This book breaks no language differences,Hasn’t even escaped Bhagat’s prejudiced preferences.I loved you once when you wrote good fun.Best of all, ‘Five Point Someone’.Since then you are stooping to your lowest low,Half Girlfriend, your final blow?Same story twice, can be an honest mistake.But three and four times? Give me a break!Name your leads and share your location,I can write your next story to Bhagat’s perfection.“Simple English is my style”,Says Chetan Bhagat all the time.I am happy with that, totally fine.But excuse me mister, where is the storyline?Your sexist one-liners are witty no more,Don’t you remember, you’ve told them before?You claim that your writing is for the rich to the slums,They have better IQs than that, don’t underestimate them.You are an author who could have been!You’ve let it go for the silver screen.Are you trying to increase you reader hood?Or simply selling out to Bollywood?There have been authors just like you,Who’ve written good books and screenplays too.But you’ve got too carried away and lost the act,And quoting your Alma matter to hide that fact.Chetan O’ Chetan, Where are you?I am not an elitist, I used to really like you.Give us simple but also different and new.Slow your star-chase and get real dude!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 24 May 2015,"Chetan Bhagat uses simple English to narrate his story. He keeps the plot easy so that the readers do not find it heavy to remember the names, scenes and happenings. The 260-pages novel is divided into three parts: Delhi, Bihar and New York. The college days is described funnily by the author as he masters in telling college and campus stories. But as soon as the book reaches Bihar, you find a sudden transformation in the writing style and even the story. For the research and minute analysis that Chetan has done on Bihar and the whole culture, attitude and priorities of locals living there should be applauded. The mindset of people living in small towns or non-metro cities is very well portrayed in the 2nd part of the book. Coming to the last part of New York, I found it to be the weakest link in the book because of which I find the book falling down to the mediocre level even when it was moving excellently in its first 2/3rd part. Therefore, the novel neither let the message overcome your previous assumptions (related to class system based on English speaking skills) nor the story impresses you at the end of the tale.  There are few scenes that definitely stay with you: When Madhav’s friend asks him to make Bihar proud by sexually involving with his high-notch metro-city girlfriend. How it keeps echoing in his mind that he has to make his state proud makes you laugh. Another moment when Madhav reciprocates to interviewers makes you jump off your seat. CB purposefully inserts scenarios that we wish to do in real life but couldn't and therefore, his story clicks with younger audience. Another thrilling experience is the moment when you realize Riya has disappeared suddenly leaving Madhav behind. Moments like this keeps Half Girlfriend in your hands until you don’t finish it off in one go. There are several drawbacks too; biggest being the anti-climax and climax. It is so stretched that you will find yourself skipping pages to find that one page which would give story a final turn. Also, the characters except Madhav and Riya aren’t being involved much otherwise it could have been more fun finding Madhav fighting against everyone’s demon of demeaning people with bad English.  Overall, Chetan Bhagat has somehow succeeded in what he wanted to deliver through this book. If you aren't speaking fluent English, you won’t be ashamed in future and will give reference of the book to the people/group of people judging you. If you hang around with a girl, kiss her and still, cannot call her your girlfriend, you have got a new term to refer what your relationship with her is. I give this book 3.25/5. I wish climax would have been a bit shorter and better. Half Girlfriend can also be called “Book version of Raanjhanaa(Sonam Kapoor statter)”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 27 October 2014,the last 20 pages are missing i hate it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 19 December 2015,"Yet again, Chetan Bhagat has produced a novel that is more a Bollywood script than a novel. The scenes and situations are constructed in such a manner that almost each and every page acts as a shout-out to all the major productions houses of Bollywood. He could very well have added a PS to the book reading something like'I have added all the spice and flavour for another major Romantic Masala Potboiler for the benefit of all the Johars and Chopras of Bollywood. And the bidding starts now'The story is quite simple with a regular Bihari boy falling head over heels in love with a girl totally opposite to him in education, lifestyle and background, which is much in tune with his earlier novel '2 States' where the protagonists are from two completely different backgrounds and have to fight against odds to come together. However, in 'Half Girlfriend', neither do the situations bring out too much of a emotional conflict or turmoil nor does the characterisation come out as an example of finesse. Moreover, some of the scenes, like the one at the end where the Bihari boy manages to locate the girl and approaches her right in the middle of her performance, make you say 'SERIOUSLY!' aloud.It is a good read for those who are not well-read and are not interested in good literature but in an entertaining enough plot to pass time before the movie based on the novel comes out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 18 May 2016,"Half girlfriend is story describes a man from remote bihar becoming a UN employee in US. He pursue his love even after many hard times. This book will let you finish in one go, but i feel hard in some middle. But eventually, author himself appears and make some plot that has great influence for the entire story. Something changed and he continues his pursuit for love. We all like what he doing in last, it get interesting when closing to climax. Its a good story, what you think about this story will not be your impression when you completes this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 15 December 2014,"Seriously ??? What was that ??? So disappointing..  Half girlfriend will leave you with full madness.. Anyways.. what else can u expect.. after few pages I just kept passing by until it said   the end "" which is the best part of the book :)  . SAD !!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 14 November 2014,"One word- AWFUL!!! Chetan Bhagat needs to understand, if we are purchasing a book and taking our time in reading it, we would need good content to keep us going. The book started off fine but by the time you reach the middle, you'd be trying really hard to read all the lines. I really had to convince myself,it will get interesting by the next page! It lacks pace and a good story line!Its hard to believe this guy wrote ""Five point someone"" !!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 28 November 2014,all respect and faith i kept on chetan losses totally in a single day after i reading this book. he writing story for bollywood or what? totally useless. i cant keep quiet and my blood pressure is increasing more and more. since it is social so im not using any harsh words. i cant tolerate yaar. now im in mood to kill any of my dear ones or drink more and die. many used to say chetan writes for youth of india. is this indian youth needs?? pure 3rd rated bollywood masala story..........,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 12 October 2014,"There are so many 5 and 4 star reviews for this book. But, I did not find it that interesting. The engrossment quotient is fine in the first half, but the second half gets really boring and obvious. The chapter that leads to the climax is unexpected and interesting, however, once you are done with that chapter, you almost know what you will find in rest of the 6 to 8 chapters. This makes it even more boring in the end.Cons:1. Its boring in quite a lot of places, except the first few ones.2. Its not a page turner by any means.Pros:1. If you are trying to learn English and need a beginner novel that lets you practice reading, then go for this book. Actually, I would recommend 5 point someone or 2 states as they are more interesting.If you are well read person or used to reading good writers, you will not like this book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1, 11 December 2014,"Bakwaas story. Chetan is assumed as changing young face of India. One thing I would like to make him aware that our Young India has so high potential, please try to portray it to show as they can really do some thing class apart but not just thinking about a girl and trying to get her. The incident where Madhav put his sources used for flying US was rubbish. People across the world put their whole life to get such opportunities, spend years to avail the chance to become something in life, but the moto shown in this book was stupid. Chetan young minds, teenage and aspirations are not used only to have gfs, girls and ***ual things rather it can be used to serve nation, transform some one's life, which I must appreciate which u showcased in Bill gates part of visit in the book, the second part of Madhav's life was quite a good, and build a strong career. But the overall impact of the story would definitley not be a career oriented, bright future &amp; absolutely wrong goal impact for young minds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 27 October 2015,"I did not plan to buy this going by the reviews. However, I happened to notice it on sale at a throwaway price along with the other books I ordered. Why not ?I should probably read everything and broaden my horizons (even if it is on the other side) and become more tolerable. As luck would have it, I had a major migraine for 3 days in a row and couldn't really focus on anything. So there is a book that wouldn't require me using my head much. Is it really a book ? Maybe just a Bollywood script:I could finish it in about 5 hours maybe lesser if not for the headache.So, I agree, it is not a unique book.It is not really a book I would read again.It is exactly like any other Chetan Bhagat book.What's new ? - The characters and the setting. New names of people.Delhi,Bihar and New York instead of Varanasi.What's old? - Everything else.But I have managed to watch every Shahrukh khan movie even when most of them used to have similar stories. So with Chetan Bhagat's books.The good things- Sentimentalism and drama keeps you hooked(Bollywood, right? minus the music)The bad thing?- Repetition ( I specifically recall a few sentences in a dialogue which go in the same way in 2 states and Revolution 2020) But of course, same author. Maybe this is his signature style. Only some people can like cheesy romantic movies. Probably not for everyone.However, I really want Chetan to stop meeting the main characters at the beginning and the end of his books. WHY? Why is it so necessary to bring yourself in ? In this one, it did not even make sense. Why would Madhav come up to the author's hotel and dump Riya' journals on him ? Why not on anyone else?About the copy: I bought it for 43 rupees. Free home delivery. It's not great. It's not bad either. One of the pages was out-of-size. But its no big deal for 43 rupees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 30 March 2015,"It's actually a good book .To start with, I must admit that Half Girlfriend is a definite improvement in terms of the style of writing and manner of narration from all Chetan Bhagat books so far and wants you to keep reading the book till the end. If you are the one who likes romantic bollywood movies , then definitely go ahead and buy it .Though some might not like the fact that the book drags the story a little and you tend to get lost in the middle and the reader tries to think why this portion of story was even there . There are some grammatical errors in the book and some words are also misspelled (May be in my version of the novel)The characters are depicted in a very filmy manner , talking about films as most of us know , now there is a movie coming up in bollywood inspired by Half Girlfriend .It is a sweet romantic novel but somewhere in the middle it looses the charm a bit .The price at which the book is selling at Amazon it should be a must buy . Good time pass .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 4 March 2015,"Boy meets girl, falls in love with her except she just wants to be friends with him plus they both are from different Indian states.Sounds predictable and what with so many stories already focussing on this theme of social, cultural differences among the various states in the culturally varied India with every second person afflicted with a similar case of I love her/him but she/he doesn't love me""", I was reluctant to take up Half Girlfriend but when some of my readers pointed out that I had not reviewed CB's latest and expressed their desire to hear about my thoughts on the book, I decided to go buy the book and read it! :)First things first, I must tell you my previous impressions about CB formed after reading all his previous books. CB is an author who writes simply, knows the issues that are common among the young Indians and has managed to make a place in their hearts. All these things make him respect worthy in my eyes. Coming to his books, I loved 2 States the best among his books and Revolution Twenty20 the least. His books are unpredictable. There is no guarantee that you will like them.Half Girlfriend takes the author's writing journey forward and here too he focuses on the issues that are pretty common and so, will be empathized upon by everyone. The title is intriguing and makes one take a second look at the book while surfing in a bookstore. The blurb is mediocre but with CB, who reads the blurb?We just see his name and pick up the book! :)When I started the book, initially I enjoyed reading about Riya and Madhav and their character development in the first 3-4 chapters. After this everything is the usual with nothing interesting to keep you bound to the book. The story could have been made more crisp, concise and simply more interesting. It drags and the scenarios and the change of places just didn't make me want to stop to take notice.The writing style is simple and can be read by everyone but this book is not meant for serious readers because you, simply, wont like it. If you are an avid CB fan and a casual reader then can give it a try. If you are new to CB then I wont recommend starting the author's book journey with this book.2 out of 5 to Half Girlfriend because I liked the title, the idea behind the book and the character development. The execution of the story fails and the scenes, after the initial part of the book," start looking too far fetched and a drag.This review is also available on my blog Njkinny's World of Books &amp; Stuff"""
2, 5 January 2015,"If you are the one who prefer watching Bollywood type lovestories, you are the one who will enjoy reading Chetan Bhagat’s “Half Girlfiend”. The blockbuster writer is as usual again successful in keeping you hooked in his story. The writing skills are excellent as if written for a reader who has extremely low level of understanding English, but for all those who enjoy reading work of masters, it is a sweet treat of ‘Happy Ending’.What you should look for –1. If you are reading this book, acknowledgement is a must read part. It makes the mood of entire setting.2. It is written after studying minute details of culture and geography.3. You may encounter reading about some well known personalities, you least expected here.4. Bihar is the better part than Delhi, it is where the story has interesting hues.5. The incidents you think have no relevance, eventually give strength to the story.6. You may tempt to eat Litti Chokha as soon as you finish this book.7. You will get some good guidelines on how to learn English.So, ignore a few flaws and enjoy reading this fiction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 29 November 2014,"The novel is okay. I read all Chetan Bhagat's books religiously, even re-read some of his works from time to time because I enjoy them. He adds a twist of humor to any situation which I particulaly liked. But lately, his works got more serious, I appreciate that, but at the same time think they are lacking in creating much intrigue. His narration used to be light-hearted, yet conveyed a motivating message at the end. This story lacks both on the subtle humor &amp; message fronts (Its just a story I know, but just mentioning my thoughts on it). Its gets tedious/dragged out after a point, I mean how long can the female-lead toy with hero's emotions and yet never commit or at least let him go, it comes across as selfish. The story hints that she's had an abusive past (am I right on this point?), but her behaviour is odd (she still allows/enjoys some intimacy, fully knowing what it could lead to...strange!!), its hard to sympathize with her. It seems to me that she never gave the guy much importance, she flitted in &amp; out of his life as she pleased. Considering this, the hero's obsession with her IMO, seems unreasonable and over-the-top, for they didn't even have a proper relationship (I have to tag it as one of those love-at-first sight things). And yes, the climax is dramatic and resembles a cliched bollywood ending. Not impressive. The only part I liked about him is the way he worked for the school's development back in his village. I did not like, nor could relate to any other characters in this story. So that's about it. And YET, eagerly awaiting your next story Chetan, please bring back your old style.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 13 November 2014,"I'm a fan of Chetan Bhagat, and enjoyed  Five Point Someone, 2 States  and The 3 Mistakes of my Life, but was disappointed with Half Girlfriend.  I found it quite incredible that a beautiful, rich socialite  and a dehati who could hardly speak English or was familiar with big city life, could fall deeply in love.  All they had in common was basketball. Not amusing or touching like the other books",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 27 October 2014,"Half star for CB’s Half girlfriend Need I say more?Okay here it goes... apart from the age old clichés this book is just an exact copy of his earlier novels, but in a hideous way. The story like others includes some sports with hardly any connection + Bill Gates out of nowhere. There is absolutely zero depth story wise or character-wise. About writing I can say the language is actually deteriorating in every sense, calling it simple English seems absurd.Main protagonist ‘the non-English type’(as CB says) Madhav was like a blessing in disguise for this ridiculous language I guess. I must admit each and every dialog in this book was so pathetic that it made me laugh out loud (well, that ½ star is for all those LOL moments).Looking back now, I don’t find any difference between CB’s male protagonist Govind, Gopal and now Madhav all are same depos, chepos , self pitting jerks yet behave like innocents in the end and all his female protagonist Vidya, Aarthi and now Riya all are so silly and lame that they always end up taking stupid decisions. There is absolutely no character differentiation amongst them what so ever. On top of that the main characters are always behind the author himself to share their life stories so that he can save them in the end and write an epic story out of it. God, Give me a break!!!!Coming back to ½ Girlfriend how the hell the title is apt for the story I am unable understand. Is it because Riya just allowed despo Madhav to kiss her and refrains him to do anything beyond that, is that it? I don’t know how else to justify this stupid title for this awful story.I don’t even understand how people are considering this as a Bollywood script(story) in my opinion it shouldn’t even be qualifying for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 31 October 2014,"Well, the story is a typical masala bollywood movie story but it indeed draws you attention towards it. I enjoyed it although it seemed much fictional and irrational, but i enjoyed it completely.And the best part it i got it at 49 rupees.4 star for the novel and 1 star for the 49 rupee purchase, makes it a 5 star. !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 16 February 2015,"Since most Chetan Bhagat books eventually do become Bollywood movies and make him even more rich :), he probably was inspired to script it before hand making it easier for the script writers chosen to create the movie in the future. While the book's write carries the usual CB reader raves such as being written in simple language, being common enough to identify with, etc.. the plot does feel a lot bollywoodish. Also, it doesn't inspire the reader to imagine much beyond or outside today's typical love story with its twists and turns. It may be worth reading once if you have the time. Otherwise, you can just wait for Adhi Girlfriend"" to hit the screens in next few years"," watch it then. You will not miss anything between the book and the movie like you do when you read some great fiction books concerning middle earth or the JK rowling series and then watch the movies.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 24 February 2015,"Half girlfriend is a good movie item. There is nothing new from Mr.Chetan Bhagat in this book. It is masaledaar and chatpati like Bingo Mad Angles. We will watch it on the silver screen soon. Actress 5'9 Anushka Sharma for sure..:D. Because in bollywood no other actress is taller than she is. Is there anyone?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 16 March 2015,"this book is just okay! Three stars because through the story of this book, Chetan has passed comments on our system on some occasion. Rest,The beautiful girl remains same from author's first book, no change even while describing her beauty. Boy is as usual typical old hindi film style. Both are hero and heroine of the book, there is a typical 90's movies rich girl and boy poor (in english) type drama and then obvious happy ending to it. St. Stephen's college described exactly same as he described IIT Delhi, IIM Ahmadabad, so just copy paste on descriptions here. Looks like this book has been written for a movie and based on the reviews to the book, the script of the movie will be edited. Nothing great about it except some funny one liners.Buy it only if you are travelling in a train and want to pass the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 26 November 2014,"Of all of the Chetan Bhagat's stories , this might look the most un real one. It was actually more like a Karan Johar type bollywood drama. Even though it was a fine story, the last part of the book where Madhav found Riya only on his last day in US seemed very unrealistic. First off, you hardly can find people like Madhav who can be so mad in love for a girl and could not forget her even after 2 and half years and secondly running till US with no proper information about the girl and finding it just on the last day of the stay was just over the top.The best part about the book was the story about the school which Madhav and his mother intended to grow and make it a success. The speech that Madhav delivered will give a strong message to all the people reading this book. That is something to be proud of. I wish there could be any 'real' Madhav in today's world who can be so determined and passionate in whatever they wish for- whether it being raising a school in rural India or running behind your love. His character was just amazing!Anyway, overall a nice book. And as always, Chetan Bhagat's book always keep you holding till the end!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 28 January 2015,"I like Chetan Bhagat's book very much he is great at his place. This is also not upto mark as expected from chetan but still an different love"" story. The book was delivered as mentioned in best condition along with a book marker. The packing was not that much good need to improve in this field. Actually i got this book at its cheapest price on republic days sale i.e. at just INR.61 which was great. NO part of the book was missing like someone said book is duplicate well it is not"," here duplicate in case like tore pages missing pages or else but this does not signify that it is duplicated like that one seeling on the streets  of MUMBAI at just INR. 70 to 100 which are actually duplicates they are scanned the printed copies of original book with same bar code on book and also same ISDN.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 3 March 2015,"Chetan Bagat is known for his novels, most of which are based on college lives. It's always the same 'ol tale that we all know.BUT, Chetan Bhagat's Half Girlfriend, although keeping the same basic outline, manages a story that is so unique you wanna read it again and again. The slow twists and turns, the secrets, the plot, the setting, the adventure, the mystery, the list goes on and on, but this book is over flowing with everything! Wow! The grammar used could have been of a higher quality, but, nevertheless, it managed to bring out the deepest of feelings and emotions out of the characters. An awesome read! It definitely is going to give you an adrenaline rush! I couldn't wait, so finished the book in 2 days!One of the best books by Chetan!A MUST READ!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 29 April 2015,"Yes, I had the guts to read this junk because I really didn't have much to do. Firstly, there was nothing wrong with Amazon's delivery or the quality of product. But, reading this made me wonder if I could sue Mr Bhagat for brain damage. This is his worst work so far, if you can call the rest of them works"". Please don't read this and save our nation from the clutches of idiocy and corporate sellouts like the ""author"" of this ""masterpiece""!

4, 26 February 2015,"Good one time read!!The best thing about all of chetan's work is the simplicity of the his plots, the village scenes.The guy struggling till the last moment, doing anything he can to get this girl back.The best scene according to me was the one when madhav struggles through the snowfall to get to the place where Riya has a performance. No public transport to take him there, the temperature is freezing low.Finally when he reaches the place and gets on to the stage when Riya is performing, Riya opening her eyes and breaking into tears on seeing madhav right in front of her.A good one time read and yes even I felt it was more of a Bollywood script.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4, 1 November 2014,First of all thanks to chetan to pull his thoughts below iit and iim .. This time it is DU's St. Stephens.Another typical love story from CB. Starting with the title.. Half Girlfriend..the phrase itself has been used only 3 or 4 times in the book n killing our imagination regarding the plot it says something else. Story simply describes the affection n love irrespective of too widened class difference and the deep dedication of protagonist to win over the fact of impossible love story.Try it if U like climax type ends.It won't take much time... I completed the whole book in 1 sitting(resting or lying) of 7 hrs(22:15 to 04:30).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 28 June 2015,"The book was a decent read. Chetan Bhagat seems to targeting the same college love angle. Chetan was probably in a hurry writing this book to get it out in time. He again might have been thinking that one of the hindi movie producers will pick up this book.The protagonist was a horny young guy who had only one thing in his mind all the time. I think it is ok to be horny at that age but this guy could only think of one thing, like his mind was shut to everything outside of this. Dont know what the girl liked in him and why was she at all attracted towards him.Anyways it was an easy read and was able to complete this in one sitting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has not been paid with my money though, but still, it is rather disappointing that you did not at least send me a message to ask me about this new name and address . I am now considering closing my account, because I found you to eager to make the deal without further inquiries .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 25 November 2014,Good one to read. And  really thanx to amazon for providing such copy in heavy discount. I also like to mention amazon provided me two book marks with this one and yup those are just a peace of paper but it shows how amazon taking care of things. Another thing about service of amazon my product got delayed due to courier service and they tagged it as 'more information required regarding my address'. I was feeling I will never get it on time after this but just after a single mail to amazon with additional address information worked over there. With in some few hours my product was in m hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5, 4 October 2014,"Half Girlfriend"" was really awesome :) The presentation of the author was even more good than his previous works.I thank Mr.Chetan Bhagat for this book! and I expect many more books from him in forthcoming days.The Amazon's delivery was the plus point.I ordered on 2nd oct and got it by 3rd oct.The one-day delivery without shipping charge was a hike for amazon.Also the package came woth tamper-proof cover which avoided the book from Foldings.Keep going! Amazon's products are of low cost compared to other shopping sites!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1, 7 September 2015,"I am amazed to see a 4+ star rating of this crap named Half Girlfriend. This is nothing but another bollywood script presented in disguise of a novel. Repetitive style of narration ( Yet again some random guy turns up for Mr.Bhagat's advice and narrates his tragic life story) Come on sir, is it the only style of narration you know, to make your story and characters look real? We know that Mr. Bhagat wants to walk on the red carpet with flashes and waving hands.Go ahead..you are a free man Mr. Bhagat but please do it Bollywood ishtyle..leave writing for sensible and worthy writers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 16 February 2015,"It was just another bollywood script from CB.Come on,CBWe have seen enough bollywood movies.And now you started writing books for bollywood.Why don't you write a script and submit that to the directors first?Basically CB is a marketer! And here he is marketing his book first.Then his movie.There was nothing new in the book,apart from the grammar-less title.Just another boy-meets-girl book.Full of cliches.I read it somewhere that this book is inspiring"".I don't know who said this.May be CB himself.!!Inspiring?

2, 12 August 2015,This book contains typical romantic bulls*** obviously with Chetan Bhagat's utterly Punjabi flavour though none of the characters have any kind of association with Punjab.Writing isn't as crisp as you'd expect from an IIM Grad.This is the first book of Chetan that I've read and next time I'll not give any more space to him in my Bookshelf for sure.Read it only if you're a beginner to novels and trying to find some kind of timepass in reading.And more importantly don't follow his characters in your real love life at any rate because that would certainly spoil everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3, 25 November 2014,Its completely a movie Story.. Chetan bhagat writes a movie Story and not a novel..he might have thought about who will be the actors and actress ..I would rate this as a good book at least for indians like me who don't have a hobby of reading much..buts its after all same as other CB books..there are some flaws in the book likePage 202: Received Whatsapp notification in 2008.. seems Whatsapp released its own version specially for CB's character for testing in 2008 as they released actual version in 2009.and some more like this ;) :P,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3, 17 January 2015,"As a foreigner who has never read any works of Chetan Bhagat but has watched the movie Three Idiots, I found it similar in plot to the movie, but still a pleasant pastime. Sure the wording is not that delicate, but it is like what we will say in our daily life but a little more witty. But I don't like the way the author arranged the the story, especially the last part; abruptly changing the storyteller, the last climax being not persuasive enough.Anyway, it's my first attempt to understand Indian pop culture, how should I put it, it's a half success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 5 February 2015,"I Just Loved it, its good novel and both character Madhav and Riya described by CB as well as Good Friends. Nice story and deadly end is awesome.

3, 30 November 2014,"Good captivating story. However ..it looks like a film script than a novel. I think the focus was on creating a film than a novel. Although its entertaining.. few things like chetan Bhagat himself being present in story, hero of the film sharing close friendship with other American singer (who eventually helps locate Ray) in spite of his English fears looks a bit unrealistic even by fiction standards. Hero's mother comes across both negative and positive character could have been dealt with differently.All in all ... easy and captivating read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 26 January 2015,"Book is not upto the mark.. too many loop holes.. some things mentioned in book are not easy to believe. The hero of the book behaved like addicted i.e. always wanted to kiss the girl. Bill gates, prince,rani sahiba, speech for school, US hunt, finding her on last day all are big disappointment. Might be because our expectation were looking for better. One thing I would like to understand from Chetan... Is it necessary to have physical relation with the girl you are calling as Girlfriend???  Cant get the logic of half or full or quarter.. whatever...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 16 October 2014,"The delivery took 9 days. First time from Amazon.But the book quality if top notch for 99 rupees.The book is average for people who know what to expect.If you want literary stuff and read Cheta Bhagat, then no one can help you.According to the genre i.e. modern India young adult literature, HG is average.Go for it, if you are a fan. Nothing extraordinary here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 27 January 2016,"Had read it in 2014, one month after it was released.The book, is a prefect blend of words for a believable yet spicy love story.The character development is good and is commendable.Riya and Madhav share an interesting and inviting chemistry, but it entertains in parts.There are moments where one can laugh and cry, moments where someone can relate themself with the story they're reading.The cover page could've been better.Would love to read more from his side, but something which could be digested in reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 20 November 2014,"As always, I'm happy with yet another work of Chetan Bhagat. Seemed like a reading a bollywood movie and I prefer reading to watching one. Also, kindly of felt like on the same lines as 'Revolution 2020', though with a happy ending. Bottom line would be, I don't care what people say about Mr.Bhagat or how much ever people criticize him. I love his work and would hope that he continues to keep entertaining us with more of his sad, unusual and witty love stories (Otherwise, I'm not into Love Stories at all). I'm gonna read it again, just for fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 13 October 2015,The best book written by Chetan Bhagat till date. He was able to describe the socio economic environment of all three places where story take place accurately and hold on the readers attention throughout the book. A enjoyable journey with the character.Story from the point of view of the female protagonist was amazing and shows how one person fail to see other persons' difficultiesI am waiting for a day when main protagonist in a Chetan Bhagat's book will be a woman.I will definitely recommend this book to all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 6 November 2014,"As all of his ealier books is simple,straight forward and downright entertaining.It kinda starts like one of his earlier books(Revolution 2020) where he meets someone and that guy narrates his story.I remembered a dialogue from one of his book turned movie while reading this book that Story mein Hero ho na ho story honi chahiye"" and I tell you this book has both..!!!.Those who are sucker for romances sure will like this book"," but I speak for all those others out there that this is a worthy read.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 11 March 2015,"I couldn't understand, how such a lame book got overall 4 star rating. This book is much worst than his last one Revolution 20-20. After reading that one I though this was Chetan's worst one. But Chetan Bhagath made me wrong with this one. From start to end I have never felt like I was reading a novel, instead I was reading the screenplay of a traditional Bollywood masala movie. A very humble request to Chetan, please don't write novels for some producers/directors in Bollywood and spend some time to think about common readers like us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 31 October 2014,"Yes, Nice Read. Chetan's distinctive style is catchy. Definitely written with Bollywood angle too. Of late the approach to buildup is repetitive of his past books (except pre-martial sex). Here too it is passable as the view of young India to the world would change over the period. Much like his central focus to the development of rural India by the fresh generation. The HSBC campus interview is hilarious. The apt description of various phases of India life makes reading interesting. Expected ending but the US part is bit dragging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 3 April 2015,Not worth even wasting money on this book.Hope some day  chetan bhagat matures from writing silly college love stories to really writing proper friction/non friction books.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 27 May 2016,"He has a very knowing format nothing new in his books, I read his every books and it's not freaking unique at all......... Boring for me if you like so go ahead buy....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 23 November 2014,"As usual from Chetan Bhagat. I see some similarities between Gautham Menon's Vaaranam Aayiram and this novel. Overall, its yet another chetan's book and nothing special",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 31 January 2016,"The Title is very Exciting and curious to read.Book is very nice, story telling pace is also upto the mark.But only bad experience was there were some pages in the book which was folded and because of that tough to read some lines, Although Amazon provide Return but since i wanted to read it as soon as possible that's why i didn't return it.Note- Advice for Amazon, Please do have a look over the book if they have any folded or damaged pages, Do not ship it. It creates difficulty to the buyer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 4 October 2014,Chetan Bhagat's yet another drama.  Entertaining story . The last few pages were very fast paced. Applaudible.!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 7 May 2015,Let me start by saying Iam not a big fan of chetan bhagatAnd this is his second book I read .I have to say that he doesn’t have much of a different tale to tell .The reason I brought the book was cheap a mere 100 rupees and I had time to kill. I would say if you read it with an open mind its a one time read. I see in many forums that people have mixed feelings about this bookTo read the complete review click the link belowhttp://ghostreviews.in/2015/05/half-girlfriend-chetan-bhagat/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 12 October 2015,I loved the book ...reading .following the previous comments i could say ..the decent riya ...is nowhere to be found in this  modern luxurious life.mostly if this stupid bihari has been fallen in love ..this actually is real.but fictious riya...is  rare .and an unimaginary ..those beutyfing descriptions about the rich chik is real by the stupid bihari.on the whole it is a combination of good time pass and entertainment.no such inspirational truths about practical love life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 9 November 2014,Total crap novel. Never expected this from chetan. Its 70's story. village boy and rich city girl. Boy chasing her and all that crap. I have a complaint with amazon as well they should provide booksmarks with novels its very important. How costly would it be to include a bookmark with a novel. The novel has been a total time waste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 9 November 2014,"Chetan's other books had a important issue wrapped in a story line. 5  point, for eg, had the cramming culture in IITs and how boys with no liking for engineering land up there.But this has such weak theme of premium on spoken English.It is not credible when a boy and a girl with absolutely nothing in common except basket ball spend hours talking to each other.Ultimately the horny boy succeeds in his one point agenda and the story has a happy ending as in other Chetan books.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 25 November 2014,The pages from 89 to 120 are missing. Pages from 55 to 88 are repeated twice and there are no 89 to 120. Completely spolit the reading experience. Cheat!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 12 October 2014,"I got it on 10th October, four days before the estimated delivery. I was too happy, But I was more than happy when I started reading it. I made it in one shot. I think most of you usually place your self in the shoes of the characters. You Dream the same as the characters do. Yes, I too do that. But this time I couldn't put myself in the shoes of Madhav, neither Rohan. How can I imagine myself as Madhav who born to a Royal family in Bihar. He was so called prince in the village but not outside it. He is now a common man living with his mother in their very old Haveli. He played basket ball for the state team and now got admission in St. Stephen's college in Delhi through the sports quota. He finds his love in the basket ball court,........and story moves on. Rohan, a boy from Punjab lives in London like Royal with his million dollars property. he can come to St Stephen's college to take Riya(female character of the story loved by both Madhav and Rohan, PLEASE DO NOT RELATE IT WITH 'REVOLUTION 2020' both the stories got unmatchable emotions YOU SHOULD READ IT.) out for a long drive in his Bantley....... So story goes on and at the end Riya finds her real love. If you want to know who the person is Madhav or Rohan? Then read the book. I am sure you'll love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 5 December 2014,"Nothing Much in this book, just like a routine Bollywood love story, the narration very similar to old novels. I did not felt excited in novel anywhere....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 23 December 2014,Its a piece of crap - Read Times Of India instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3, 9 August 2015,"Chetan bhagat being such a great author has been considerably disappointing with this book. C'mon chetan! I mean really! You are presenting the same old horny heroes that u introduced in your previous books. Nothing new buddy! And for the story, it is extremely Bollywood. But even though the repetitiveness, the book is quite a page turner. You'll read it in a few stretches. That's the only reason for 3 stars. Nevertheless, not highly recommended. Light hearted book. Can be avoided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 6 October 2014,"'Half Girlfriend' - A nice novel from Chetan Bhagat! Much better than his last one. A very good plot, very nice narration and the way the story went from start to finish, through the ups and downs of the protagonist... very good!I was very sceptical about the book after seeing the title as well as the story line in the back cover. Also my experience with 'Revolution 2020' made me wonder whether I should read this book or not! Happy that I decided to give it a try!I can see that Mr. Bhagat is now writing stories in a more script-like manner, tailor-made for movies and I don't see any harm in that! It is written well, and seems so good to be made into a movie without much changes!A good short read whether you are a CB fan or not!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1, 29 November 2014,Terrible!No doubt the concept is great. But the narration as well as the characters are too boring to hook you.Please Dont Buy It!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 7 June 2016,a good book to read.. true love will always find its way.. the story portrays this point beautifully.. but the last few pages were too long to read,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 20 May 2016,The book talks about the courage one should have to take a person to the top by not quitting and trying again and again to reach a point of shift.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 12 February 2016,"Madhav Jha falls for Riya the day he meets her. Riya is not ready for love at the time. Madhav is typical desperate lover. he loses her .His character does justice to a typical Bihari Boy.His idealistic thinking, his dilema and his resolute response to comeback to his native place has been captured beautifully but most beautifully his love for the only girl he loved. the fate makes the two meet again and what happens next will touch the heart of everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4, 30 August 2015,"The book is amazing. The story is perfectly framed but it is totally bolywood style story.Some of the middle parts are boring and doesn't make sense but then also it's fine. Love story of Madhav and Riya is kinda good.So just read and find out what Madhav does to find his love. And how she, his half-girlfriend, runs away from him!And also an if you like this book, go ahead and read I too had a love story"" by Ravinder Singh.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please do not waste your time on this cheap masala bollywood screenplay.For others I think you should wait until this book is adapted to a bollywood flick. clearly you will enjoy the latter.I would like to request Mr. Chetan Bhagat to directly publish his works as screenplay, rather than novel. Then in the next IIFA or FILMFARE awards he will definitely bag the first spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5, 29 June 2015,"I was eagerly wanted to read what happens in next so i completed reading the book in just 3 days.... WHAT A STORYChetan Bhagat wrote exactly what boys think in particular situation, in different emotion, wants to say more , want to communicate more but the fact CAN'T. Where misunderstandings stared. You know just for silence relationships face worse n worse conditions. JUST SAY IT WHAT YOU FEEL.Definitely to read............",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2, 9 January 2015,"well,  i didn't purchased it from Amazon... actually I downloaded the PDF version ...

3, 14 November 2015,"This was my first novel of chetan bhagat and I liked it. The writing style is simple yet interesting. It is a story of a village boy introduced in a whole new world, one can relate to it but the fairy tale touch to the story can't be ingnored. In the end you feel good as the story ends happily. One time read so better don't waste your money buying it and if you can borrow from a friend ( as many people have it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1, 27 June 2015,"Sorry to say but I never understood what's so special in Chetan Bhagat's writings.
